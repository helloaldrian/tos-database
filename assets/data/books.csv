However, Schaffen too, uses arrows. {nl} But unlike fired arrows, Her bow is permanent even with continued use.  {nl}{np}Even if it was impossible to create arrows that can be used permanently, Lydia Schaffen delved into arrow crafting techniques. {nl} Obtaining materials neccesary to craft arrows was another problem. {nl}{np}Troubled greatly by this problem, Lydia Schaffen went on a journey to find the solution. {nl} Whether or not she had been granted blessing by the goddess when she met the Fletcher Master or if she found the solution to her problem, Historians will continue to debate about the topic. {nl}{np}Many Fletchers had been produced ever since the dawn of time. But talentless numbers are irrelevant. {nl} People just call him the Fletcher Master, Lydia Schaffen too,was uncertain of his name. {nl}{np}Ever since his rise to fame, People called him the Fletcher Master. People who knew his real name were swept away by the passings of the river of time. {nl} His real name, according to some scholars, was said to be John Blacksmith. but the name itself isn't getting any credibility, since you cannot readily accept a famous name that common. {nl}{np}Anyway, Lydia Schaffen met this the Fletcher Master who was an arrow expert.

Readable.,icon_item_collection_01red,,,,,,Silver of Fedimian,1,"This is from before there was a large statue in Fedimian.{nl}Of course, there was a small statue even then.{np}A long time ago, the people of Fedimian were quite normal, {nl}not much different from the ordinary people of the rest of the world. {nl}However, the people of Fedimian did differ from their worldly peers in one aspect.{np}The people of Fedimian were very cautious.{nl}In the sense that they take the word 'cautious' much more seriously. {nl}These people were as cautious around fire as they were without.{np}The Fedimians were modest about this with others. {nl}Even those who stayed at Fedimian for a while could not pick up the trait.{np}Thanks to this behavior, the people of Fedimian fared better during tough times, {nl}as they were able to sense danger coming.{np}Because of this, no few words were said about the cautiousness of the Fedimian people.{np}In Fedimian, if someone dropped money on the ground, it would be gone forever. {nl}In a world where money mostly consists of silver coins, {nl}only the creditors would know exactly how much money has been lost in this manner.{np}Why money disappears into the ground at Fedimian remains unknown. {nl}Some people believe the Goddess Zemyna absorbs any money that makes contact with her area. {nl}Most commoners, however, believe this was done to reduce the demand of silver coins from creditors.{np}By believing that the goddess herself takes the silver,{nl}the people found it pointless to try and dig it up in her grounds. {nl}The fact that you can offer silver coins at Fedimian as tribute to her reinforces this idea.{np}In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil {nl}has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money.{np}However, as much as one tries to be careful, mistakes still happen. {nl}More so with the case of young girls. {nl}One day, it happened to a girl named Aiste.{np}Normally, when one drops silver coins on the ground, it would scatter about on the road, {nl}and then disappear without a trace. {nl}{nl}Fedimians usually curse their own carelessness and move on, {nl}but Aiste was different: she wondered why and how it happened.{np}To find out what happened, Aiste began inspecting the area she lost her coins at. {nl}In her search she came across a beggar beside the deep end of the canal.{np}Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the silver coins I dropped? Would you return them to me? I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'{nl}{nl}{np}The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'{nl}{nl}{np}Almost immediately, the beggar felt guilty of the mocking words he blurted out. He apologized to Aiste.''Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your silver coins here.'{nl}{nl}{np}Upon hearing the beggar's words, Aiste thanked the beggar, and went on to follow his advice. {nl}Through his selfless act, the beggar suddenly felt a revived sense of responsibility. He looked toward the silhouette of the leaving Aiste, his heart heavy and warm from this experience.{np}Aiste went to the orchards at the outskirts of Fedimian where she worked. {nl}While one could just pick fruit from the trees there, it was also important to take the fruit that fell on the ground.{np}Smaller hands worked better for picking fruits, so young children were often hired at the orchards. {nl}Some orchards took it a step further: hiring monkeys, whose hands were smaller than that of children, to pick fruit. Monkeys did work more effectively than children, but often ate the fruit they picked. Thus, most owners relied on hiring children.{np}Returning, Aiste visited the orchard she worked at and explained her situation to the orchard owner. {nl}Unfortunately, the owner was not in a good mood, having just had a quarrel with his wife. {nl}He, like all other Fedimians, knew about the phenomenon, and saw no reason to give Aiste more money.{np}And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a second pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money. {nl}{nl}{np}He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'{nl}{nl}{np}Aiste set towards the silversmith's place as soon as she heard those words. {nl}Fortunately, the house was located outside Fedimian walls. {nl}Had it been inside, the silversmith ran the risk of losing his money and silverware to the soil.{np}It is for this reason that he lives on the outskirts of Fedimian. {nl}Aiste knocked on the front door and explained her situation to him as soon as he answered.{np}The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'{nl}{nl}{np}Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'{nl}{nl}{np}Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna must be taking them.'{nl}{nl}{np}Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the goddess.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the goddess to return my silverware?'{nl}{nl}{np}The silversmith did not take to heart his own words, but Aiste did. {nl}She immediately set out to do as she said. The silversmith felt sorry for Aiste, {nl}but did not have the courage to call her back as she faded into the distance.{np}An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at the Statue of Goddess Zemyna. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the Goddess Statue represented, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, goddess. Please return my lost silver coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.{nl}{nl}{np}How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have come to take back what you have lost?'{nl}{nl}{np}Aiste knew in her heart that it was Goddess Zemyna that was addressing her. {nl}She stopped crying, cleared her voice and replied so.{np}The goddess' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what your asking from me is not in a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits to those who do not work.'{nl}{nl}{np}'But I worked very hard today!'{nl}{nl}{np}'I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'{nl}{nl}{np}The goddess' voice faded with those words, and Aiste found silver coins under her feet. {nl}She looked to where she had left her silvers and found that the tears she shed had transformed into coins.{nl}Aiste was very happy, and made sure to pick up all the silver before leaving.{np}After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some silver. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'{nl}{nl}{np}As the silversmith held out his silver coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the goddess returned all my coins. On top of that she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost silver, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'{nl}{nl}{np}At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra silver.'{nl}{nl}{np}Aiste obliged and gave her extra coins to the silversmith. {nl}After this, the silversmith gave Aiste a bag of coins.{np}After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried about him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'{nl}{nl}{np}The orchard owner took out a large amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'{nl}{nl}{np}Saying that, Aiste opened the bag of coins she got from the silversmith and showed the orchard owner. {nl}The orchard owner was extremely surprised, as the amount of money she got from the goddess and the silversmith surpassed the amount he had.{np}Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.{nl}{nl}{np}She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the silver coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost silver.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's silver and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your silver coins too.'{nl}{nl}{np}Even though the beggar was exhausted, he cupped his hands to get his coins back. {nl}Seeing this, Aiste was brought to the brink of tears. {nl}She wondered how much begging the beggar had to do to give her her coins back. {nl}With a heavy heart, Aiste gave the old beggar the coins.{np}After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my silver. I was given this through Goddess Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.{nl}{nl}{np}The beggar looked towards Aiste's distant shadow, and opened the present she gave him, {nl}curious to what was inside. Inside, he was surprised to find dozens of silver coins. {nl}Now he understood why Aiste was able to depart much more quickly than she arrived - she had lightened her load by giving him the excess.{np}For a beggar who had been stingy over a single silver coin, the fact Aiste could simply give away several tens of times that amount moved him. {nl}The fact that Aiste, who had went off and solved the mystery of Fedimian, came back and gave him what she really didn't owe, made the beggar thankful.{np}The more he thought, the less the beggar was able to hold back his tears. {nl}As he cried, he noticed something odd - every shining teardrop that touched the ground transformed to silver coins.{np}The beggar could not believe his eyes, but quickly remembered Aiste words about a blessing from the goddess. {nl}After a while, the beggar stopped crying, and went to pick up the coins and put them in the bag Aiste gave him.{np}A few days later, the beggar went to the statue that Aiste prayed to. There, he took out one coin from the bag to keep, and offered the rest to the Goddess Statue. {nl}He then prayed to the goddess whole-heartedly and left. As the money he offered disappeared, the beggar again to shed tears, but that's another story.{np}After a few days, an odd rumor spread across Fedimian. {nl}The rumor claimed that silver no longer disappeared into Fedimian soil. {nl}The rumor did not sit well at first with older, experienced people, but some tested the rumor with a paltry amount of silver, {nl}and it turned out to be true. Everyone agreed that finally, the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian has come to an end.{np}After some time, word of this occurrence reached the king. Curious as to why this happened, the king ordered an investigation. {nl}The hidden truth was brought to light, and Aiste's story was known.{np}The king praised the people that caused the miracle with their charitable hearts. {nl}Additionally, to honor the grace of the goddess, he decided to spend the national treasury to build a large statue dedicated to her.{np}On the day the statue was finally completed, {nl}something miraculous happened as the King and Aiste went together to make the first offering. {nl}From the circumference of the statue sprouted coins - all the silver coins that had been lost by Fedimians up until that time.{np}After heated debate, the Fedimian people decided to not to hoard their lost silver coins. {nl}Instead, they asked the king to collect all the coins and distribute them among the poor of the Kingdom. {nl}The king readily agreed, and gave the order to record this beautiful event into the history of the Kingdom.{np}Even now, nobody knows when and how the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian started, {nl}but everybody knows when, how, and who helped unravel the mystery. {nl}It was through the kindness of Aiste and the people who helped her, as well as through the grace of the goddess, that the mystery came to an end.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0
690004,Book4,No target is invisible for a trained archer! Readable.,icon_item_collection_04black,,,,,,Lydia Schaffen Crossroads,1,"{S35} {nl} Lydia Schaffen Crossroads {/}{np}This is a record to the Royal Family about a story when King Kadumel asked Lydia Schaffen whether she can hit a target behind a boulder or a tree, and how she simply answered the King with the crisp sound of her arrow hitting the target. However, there are some written inconsistencies from the royal record and the folklore. That is, King Kadumel noted at the time, he was not giving Schaffen a test of her abilities with a bow.{np}A more important fact is what sort of target Lydia Schaffen hit. Or to put it more precisely, who she hit, would be of great significance.{nl}Whenever the royal records and the folklore handle this story, they do not reference the time when it arose.{nl}{np}Both versions simply introduce the heroic story by focusing on Lydia Schaffen's great bow skills.{nl}There is a certain reason for this.{nl} The reason is that this story happened in the final days of the Civil War. Differing from the known folklore, Ruklys was not killed by King Kadumel's soldiers in the last layer of the Fortress of the Land. It is said that Ruklys had a particular reason for not letting any outsiders into the heart of his fort.{nl}{np}Rather than dying, Ruklys escaped moments before his fort was overrun, and King Kadumel ordered his soldiers to go pursue him.{nl} After the pursuit, Ruklys found himself cornered at the edge of a cliff.{np}There was a large enough rock on the cliff for Ruklys to put his back against while facing the cliff and keeping the King's soldiers at the opposite face of the rock.{nl} Ruklys leaned his back on the rock so the King's archer who tracked him could not attack.{nl} If it were a different location they could have gone to the left and right to surround and rain arrows, but the cliff, alongside the battle formation, was not a place for such attacks.{nl}{np}Having no archers who could shoot across the air beyond the cliff, King Kadumel unquestionably drove his soldiers towards the edge of the cliff.{nl}{np}However Ruklys and his remaining men repelled the King's soldiers, showing their inhuman ability to persist day and night. This even caused the King's peasant soldiers to begin to waver.{nl} Furthermore, Ruklys' heroic struggle made such an impression to some of Kadumel's men and officers, that some started questioning Kadumel's command.{nl} Already unpopular among people under his rule, King Kadumel could not continue pushing his men to their death, he also could not wait until Ruklys died of hunger or fatigue.{nl}{np}And through this situation, King Kadumel asked a clever question to Lydia Schaffen.{nl}  Of course, Lydia did not take King Kadumel's provocation as a chance to show her skills and fire a meek high angle shot to kill Ruklys. There were other reasons that were overlapping here.{np}But considering these reasons, in any case, such as having her master's wishes, or the thought that she ended someone's life through her own hands, we as the current generation can only guess how hurt and conflicted were Lydia Schaffen's emotions. Henceforth, people became knowledgeable of the time when Lydia Schaffen easily pierced a target behind a boulder from the crossroads, however, Lydia would bear an immeasurable complex emotion about the crossroads from that day forward.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

Readable.,icon_item_collection_01red,,,,,,Lydia Schaffen's Notch,1,"{s35}{nl}Lydia Schaffen's Notch{/}{np}This story is said to have taken place one day at the Astral Tower.{nl}A dispute among the disciples of Lydia Schaffen broke out.{nl}Several disciples gathered after the training and in the process such a dialog is said to have come up: 'No matter how good your bow is, if your skills are lacking, you can't bring out its full potential. Therefore, what is important in the end is your own skill.'{nl}Such was a claim of a certain disciple, which started the dispute.{nl}{np}'You are forgetting the basics of archery. What is an archer? It is someone who uses a tool called a bow, right?{nl}Do you think an archer existing without a bow is possible? {nl}Even if one gets famous for their skill with sword and spear, can one still call themselves an archer? In the end, archery is the concept of depending on tools, isn't it?'{nl}{np}The disciple who had a different view argued back:{nl}'You said tools are important, let's talk about that.{nl}What is a bow? There are various weapons for an archer. Just like there are weapons that don't need much skill to handle, like a crossbow, there are also weapons, effectiveness of which varies a lot based on a user's skill, like the ones of the Wugushi.{nl}The Wind Arrow of the Wugushi is hard to master, it's a difficult weapon to wield for someone without experience, no matter how good the materials of one's bow are.{nl}{np}However, calling a catapult or a crossbow a weapon anyone can handle is not correct.{nl}You claim archery exists solely because there are tools, this is wrong.{np}This is the same as saying that since people will die if they don't eat, their lives are less important than food and depend on it.{nl}Are you claiming that since you eat to be able to live on, you are living to eat?'{nl}Upon that, another disciple shared his viewpoint:{nl}'You are arguing about the path of the Archer, but you are only concentrating on one aspect.{nl}What you fail to address is that no matter how famous an Archer one is, no matter how eagle-eyed one is, what they are using to their advantage is the wind. {nl}{np}The arrow could not be shot if it wasn't for the wind and air that carries it to the mark, how could any sharpshooter exist, or rather, how much would an archer be able to do in that case? In the end, what is necessary for an archer is to sense the wind flow and to be able to act on it.'{nl}{np}From then on, the disciples argued to no end, claims became more diverse and interesting, theories fired back and forth.{nl}Finally, they started wondering about what their master, Lydia Schaffen, would think of this.{nl}After having told her about the discussion they've had so far, they waited for her reply.{nl}{np}When the disciples came to Lydia Schaffen, she is said to have been eating chestnuts using an arrowhead, dangerously perched on the railing of the Astral Tower.{nl}{np}Lydia Schaffen continued eating while listening to the disciples, keeping her position on the railing. After they finished, she kept quiet for a while, but before long she fiddled with her fingers through the pile of shells of chestnuts she had eaten and picked out something, reportedly saying this: {nl}'What is this?'{nl}The disciple with the sharp eyes answered before anyone could.{nl}'It's the inner skin of a chestnut.'{nl}{np}It was very obvious that it was indeed the inner skin of a chestnut, so the others nodded in agreement and waited for their master's next words. {nl}And so Lydia Schaffen continued. {nl}'No. This is the notch of my arrow.'{nl}{np}Having said so, she pinched the inner skin of a chestnut between her fingers, took her bow that was lying beside her as always and fired into the sky using the inner skin as a notch. {nl}It is said that Lydia Schaffen has settled the dispute of the disciples that way, jumped from the railing she was sitting on and left, leaving the disciples bewildered.{nl}",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

Readable.,icon_item_collection_02green,,,,,,Lydia Schaffen and Rumpelstiltskin ,1,"{s35}Lydia Schaffen and Rumpelstiltskin {/} {np}This is a story about Lydia Schaffen that has been handed down throughout the Kingdom. {nl}Furthermore, while there are places that Lydia Schaffen has never been to according to historical records, there are stories about what happened when she visited their village.{nl}These stories contain absurd things such as dragons appearing, a strange demon which is different from the demon we know laying a wager with Lydia Schaffen.{nl}{np}In spite of that, the villagers from the region believe the story beyond doubt, and they embrace the pride that this story about Lydia Schaffen brings, having originated from their hometown.{nl}{np}Compared to Ruklys, who likely died early on during the Civil War, or Flurry, who rarely left the tower she built, Lydia Schaffen definitely went on a greater number of adventures around the world, making her the most suitable as the protagonist of a story.{nl}This is one of those stories.{nl}{np}It is not known how true the story really is. Perhaps it was just as absurd in the past as it would definitely be absurd in the present. Still, the fact that it is still told today means the story agrees with the nature of Lydia Schaffen.{np}One day Lydia Schaffen left a certain village alone and walked around at night.{nl} Lydia Schaffen saw a traveler sitting wearily at the roadside on a woodland road. {nl} Out of curiosity, she decided to approach him.{nl} 'Why are you sitting here in the forest in the middle of the night?'{nl}The traveler was hesitant to answer at first, but after being asked multiple times he finally opened his mouth. {nl}The reason was apparently this: {nl}{np}The traveler had met a demon named Rumpelstiltskin when passing through the forest several days ago. {nl}Then he was lured into playing a game with the demon. {nl}{np}The reward for winning the game was significant, but the game with the demon was not easy. In the end, the traveler lost to Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}The traveler kept sighing as he waited for Rumpelstiltskin to come back. {nl} After hearing the traveler's story, Lydia Schaffen decided to confront the demon. She promised to the traveler that she'll help him with all her might. Some time passed, and Rumpelstiltskin appeared.{np}Lydia offered Rumpelstiltskin to let the traveler go and play a game with her in exchange. {nl}For better or for worse, Rumpelstiltskin was well aware of Lydia Schaffen's reputation, and the fact that she requested a game with him excited him into accepting her request. {nl}{np}In the past, Rumpelstiltskin was quite famous for challenging his opponents to use their best skill and then defeating them. {nl} But, he changed the rules of his game a bit every time. {nl} Lydia Schaffen asked: 'I understand that you want to challenge my archery skill, so what are we going to do?'{nl}{np}'Of course, a game to see who is better with a bow would not be that interesting. Therefore, let's play a game where you fire an arrow at a target, and then I will try to catch and ride the arrow before it reaches the target,' said Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}Lydia replied, questioning the proposal: 'Ride an arrow?'{nl}'That is correct,' averred Rumpelstiltskin.{nl}{np}Upon answering, Rumpelstiltskin started to shrink his body.{nl} Once he had reduced himself to the size of a child's fist, Rumpelstiltskin spoke: 'Well, this size will allow me to ride your arrow, right?'{nl}Lydia Schaffen thought for a bit,{nl}'There is a problem with that, though. If you touch the arrow and cause it to fall to the ground without it ever hitting the target, then wouldn't that still be a loss for me regardless of whether you rode the arrow or not?'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin answered her with these words.{nl}{np}'Then how about this. I win if I can ride your arrow until it reaches the target.'{nl} 'And if your arrow falls to the ground,' he continued, 'then we both lose.'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin added, 'The game shall have three rounds, best two out of three.'{nl}{np}After Rumpelstiltskin's seemingly honest answer, Lydia Schaffen replied, 'Alright, one more thing: I'm going to shoot at any target, in any direction. I'll tell you what the target is each round. This way, you won't be able to get used to it for rounds two and three. Are you okay with this?{nl}'Alright, let's do that,' agreed Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}After also agreeing upon terms of defeat, the game between two people, err, one person and one demon began.{nl}{np}Lydia Schaffen weighed her arrow, then called out the first target:{nl}'The tallest brown tree over there!'{nl}With those words, she released the arrow and it sliced through the air at a frightful speed{nl}{np}Rumpelstiltskin moved nimbly to chase the flying arrow, and after he got on, the arrow impaled the tree. As the arrow continued to oscillate, he danced to the rhythm of the oscillation and sang an unknown tune.{nl}Lydia Schaffen again gauged her arrows, then she called:{nl}'All of the cones on that pine tree on my front-left side!'{nl}Upon calling the target, Lydia Schaffen unleashed her godlike archery skills. {np}Her arrows poured faster than heavy rain during a hot summer day, as if hundreds, or even thousands of arrows were fired at the same time in the same direction. {nl}{np}Rumpelstiltskin couldn't take it as calmly this round. Faster than the human eye could distinguish, Rumpelstiltskin landed on each arrow one by one and transferred to another as the barrage cut through the air. In the end, he was able to get onto the last arrow before it reached the last pine cone.{nl}Rumpelstiltskin spoke to Lydia Schaffen while trying to catch his breath.{nl}{np}'So there, I managed to sit on every single arrow before the last arrow reached the target. I win.'{nl} Lydia Schaffen replied,{nl}' Certainly, I can't deny the fact you sat on every arrow before the last one reached its target.'{nl}{np}Rumpelstiltskin gave a wicked grin after hearing Lydia Schaffen's words and said,{nl}'Meaning, I won this game. Now, as for the penalty we agreed on...'{nl}Before Rumpelstiltskin could finish, Lydia Schaffen shook her head and spoke,{nl}'Don't tell me that because you won two rounds, you won't play the final round? It's not acceptable, we clearly promised to play three rounds anyway, didn't we?'{nl}{np}'The game doesn't end before the third round, so I think it's pointless to talk about penalties before the game has actually ended...'{nl}{np}Recognizing that he has already won two rounds and had no reason to refuse a third, as well as the fact the game was certainly not over yet, Rumpelstiltskin had no choice but to abide by Lydia Schaffen's words.{nl}And so the final round began, Lydia Schaffen gauged her last arrow, and called out as she pulled the bowstring back:{nl}'My target is... the moon in the sky!'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin side-saddled the arrow as soon as it left the bowstring, and not before long, he realized what he heard.{np}And, as he rode the arrow towards the moon, Rumpelstiltskin also realized the fact that the game couldn't end until he reached it.{nl}As time passed, the power of the arrow subsided and it began falling towards the ground. However, after a time the arrow that Rumpelstiltskin rode on stopped still, floating in the sky.{nl}{np}Just as Rumpelstiltskin, grinding his teeth, was about to open his mouth, Lydia Schaffen said,{nl}'For the game to end, you need to ride the arrow until it arrives at its target. The game cannot end before then. If you manage to touched the moon and come back, then I will definitely accept the penalty.'{nl}Having said so, Lydia Schaffen began walking away as Rumpelstiltskin watched, grinding his teeth once again, unable to change the course of the game.{np}According to the anecdote, Rumpelstiltskin has not reached the moon yet, and is still flying there using the magic in his body. {nl}One can only guess if he will manage to return before his demonic life span ends.{np}Nevertheless, as we know, Lydia Schaffen has passed away long ago. So while the demon did not lose the game, he has lost his chance to win the game forever. {nl}Still, the one matter left that we, as the current generation, are curious about is what the agreed penalty between Lydia Schaffen and Rumpelstiltskin was. {nl}Of course, we could ask a particular person, err, demon, that may or may not still be alive.

690007,Book7,Essential Reading for Linkers: Finding The Nexus Point Of All Ego. Readable.,icon_item_collection_03blue,,,,,,The Expansion of Atman,1,"The Expansion of Atman{np}Congratulations on receiving this book, which no criminal may see. There are many ways to use magic, but the magic used by Linkers are a particular case. Other mages exercise effect-based powers rather than magic. That is to say, to fight an enemy with a fireball, or with lightning, does not truly bind the enemy with magic. {np}These attacks only use magic to make a fireball and lightning. Then, the mages control the magical energy's direction and destination, releasing it after settling on both.{np}In other words, these mages are unable to handle enemies without Linkers; as they need to channel and regulate surrounding energy, these mages do not have the time to easily handle targeting their magic towards an enemy. However, as you have chosen to walk the path of the Linker, the way of your magic will differ completely. The way of a Linker's magic is by directly linking your magic with your opponent's magic, which includes searching for your target within seconds.{np}Also, in the case of linking more than 2 targets, a Linker's way of magic is complicated even further if the targets have mutually opposing properties. In these situations, the Linker must use a viable magical property to connect the targets with opposing properties.{np}Thus to some extent, the Linkers are experienced magic users who still have a lot of new fields to test. Even if there are those predestined to be Linkers, fledging mages who have developed their abilities to control magic are recommended becoming Linkers and walking the path of a Linker. Above all, the most important matter about Linkers is the establishment of their truly resolved soul, or Atman. Without it, it is possible for attacks directed at a magically linked target to return towards the Linker.{np}For this reason, Linkers differ from other mages in which they must remember to use their magically established self as a tool. Particularly, when you must face other Linkers, your Atman is even more important.{np}Congratulations again on receiving this book. The fact that you were able to find this book means that you have successfully found some sort of link between the visible world and the invisible world. Consequently, if you experience difficulty searching for a magical linkage point within a group of targets hereafter, it'll become easier to cast away insincerity.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

Readable.,icon_item_collection_04black,,,,,,Armor from the Kadumel Era,1,"Armor from the Kadumel Era{/}{np}{nl}{nl}Vados Winterspoon{np}{nl}{nl}10 years have passed since I began my research. Now, exactly 30 years after the Civil War, I finally have results to show.{nl}Although the purpose of this research is to satisfy my small curiosity, if the scope were to be broadened, it may prove beneficial to the Winterspoon family.{nl}{np}Anyway, after spending a long time searching every nook and cranny for information about Ruklys and his followers, I reached a conclusion.{nl}*These notes were compiled after the... from King Kadumel's men..., on the assumption that there are no contradictions.*{nl}During the period when the Civil War took place, there weren't any significant differences between the King's army and rebel army.{np}Both sides had armaments of comparable quality.{nl} King Kadumel's army outnumbered the rebel army, but the Fortress of the Land and its surrounding city (now called Petrified City) was a favourable position to be situated in.{np}Many of the attackers had to attack through a funnel, is my conclusion.{nl}These tactics reduced the numerical advantage from 10-to-1 to 3-to-1. *Ruklys intended to make a heroic defense in the Fortress of the Land*, The likelihood of victory is not great, even with 20 times the amount of troops. A theory commonly accepted by military scholars.{nl}{np}King Kadumel had a numerical advantage in troops, but other factors involved are just as important.{nl}A significant difference, for example, is how wars are fought now compared to a thousand years ago.{np}There have been many advances in military science, but the changes created by the development of the magical academy is incomparable. Warfare with magicians as combatants add a lot more elements for commanders to consider.{np}This was the key difference between the armies of Ruklys and King Kadumel.{nl}{np}If one side had magicians whereas the other side did not, the difference between troops and equipment is meaningless. It is estimated that the number of magicians in King Kadumel's army was substantial.{nl}{np}*Although Ruklys' mentor was against fighting an army that has a considerable number of magicians, the war could not be avoided.*{np}Typically, the number of soldiers and their equipment greatly influences the tide of battle; however, with the inclusion of magicians, such was not the case as it turns out during the civil war.{np}This phenomenon creates some issues to how the past was analyzed. If King Kadumel had not properly utilized the magicians, then it would be his folly and incompetence. As for the exceptional bravery Ruklys demonstrated, there may be another explanation to it.{nl}{np}The perspectives like those are not all invalid. However, one thing must be said about the result of this research. That is the metal Ruklys and his followers used for their armor.{np}The purpose of the research is to examine why magic was not effective in the battle against Ruklys and his followers.{nl}{np}In other words, it's a possibility that Ruklys' forces were armed with Mana Metal powerful enough to negate the magical attacks of magicians.{nl}At first, this may sound absurd.{np}The fact that a metal, Mana Metal, with such high resistance against magic exists is strange, but if such a metal does exist, then there couldn't have been enough to make more than one set of armor. The commander, Ruklys, would have been the only one wearing such an armor, otherwise it wouldn't make sense if the Mana Metal were distributed to that many of his troops.{nl}It is just as reasonable that the opposite was true.{np}If one were to write about this, he/she can think of an objection to this immediately.{nl}In order to support this claim, one would need to find evidence of such a phenomena.{nl}{np}If I personally have not reached the conclusion myself, I would not have believe such wild hypothesis.{nl} What we have discovered was that the particular type of Mana Metal does not become fractured in the extreme cold temperatures. Other seemingly sturdy metals are highly vulnerable to extreme temperatures. No matter how strong a certain type of metal is, it will crack into many pieces at cold temperatures.{nl}{np}However, the Mana Metal Ruklys collected did not have such a weakness.{nl}{np}Upon visiting the location of the Fortress of the Land, my conclusion was proven correct. Pieces of the Mana Metal were found. I believe that they were used in battle. My hypothesis is that a small amount of the Mana Metal is sufficient to protect against the Kings' magician's wide area magic spells.{nl}{np}Let's move our focus unto Ruklys. According to credible records, all the magic attacks even from the royal magicians were useless against Ruklys so the casualty toll kept rising until they had to use Lydia Schadden's arrow. Such supports my hypothesis.{nl}{np}Judging from the clues discovered, Ruklys should have been wearing magic resistant armor at the time.{nl}{nl}Combined with other clues during that period of time, the armor Ruklys was wearing must have been produced using a large amount of Mana Metal.{np}So I shall call this Mana Metal 'Cold Iron' temporarily. {nl}{nl}",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

Readable.,icon_item_spellbook_1,,,,,,The Gambler of Klaipeda,1,"The Gambler of Klaipeda{np}{nl}{nl}In the town of Klaipeda, there once lived a man by the name of Modestas. {nl}He was a good, honest man - but had one major flaw that his friends and family all worried about, his wife especially so. {nl}Modestas was not lazy nor very clever nor not too foolish. {nl}He did not drink or repeatedly get into fights. {nl}The man had one flaw, and it was that he loved to gamble.{nl}{np}During the day, Modestas would work hard and would never let himself go hungry - {nl}but whenever he earned more than he really needed, he would gamble. {nl}The wife would always try to save this money, but not one extra coin would ever go toward their home.{np}Whenever she could, Modestas' wife would often go to the shrine, and pray to the goddess' likeness. {nl}But Modestas continued his odd habits, and the people around him grew increasingly concerned. {nl}After all, the mind of a gambler would think, 'Today it may be small, but tomorrow it could be big!' {nl}And so the days rolled by, same as they ever were, until one peculiar day.{np}Like most of his days, Modestas was heading home after gambling away his excess coins. {nl}He was walking through the Siauliai Woods on the path to Klaipeda, when he saw a strange, old woman on the road.{np}This old woman seemed not only old and frail, but had an unnerving aura around her. {nl}She was acting strangely, as if deep in thought or as if she was obsessed with whatever she was doing. {nl}Modestas thought about simply ignoring the woman and walking past. Nothing would have happened if he did that, {nl}but curiosity got the better of him.{np}To be precise, what really turned his head toward the old woman was what she held in her hands. {nl}Gold. The woman seemed to be obsessing over two gold pieces, doing something with them. {nl}Unable to hear her mumbling, Modestas drew closer to the strange woman.{np}Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich... but there's no life in these things...' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at baby gold will do something?'{nl}{np}The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If this way bears fruit, it'll be safe and secure.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.{nl}{np}'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'{nl}{np}The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'{nl}{np}'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - That won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'{nl}{np}'No. No matter how unlucky it may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'{nl}{np}Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win coin, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?{nl}{np}With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each, should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'{nl}{np}Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for the time... you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}{np}'Well...' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand...' {nl}''On the other hand...'?' Modestas said, tensely.{nl}{np}'When I win, then after this, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object, but thought of the victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.{nl}{np}As Modestas and the old woman parted ways, he, in any case, knew he now had a dangerous power guaranteeing his victory at any time in the near future. {nl}He walked, looking for the next person to bet huge on. As he wondered how much to wager on his next move, he heard the sound of galloping behind him.{np}Modestas turned around. It was his good old friend, Sigfried, riding on horseback towards him. {nl}They knew each other well, as both had been together through the highs and lows of gambling. They exchanged greetings and talked about where they were going. Sigfried dismounted to walk at a leisurely pace with his friend, idly chatting along their way. {nl}{np}However, before long, Modestas could no longer continue walking with Sigfried. {nl}He was fully aware of his deadline, and had no time for such trivial activities. {nl}{np}Even during their normal everyday conversations, Modestas and Sigfried unconsciously made big and small bets. Eventually, one would utter the word, 'Bet?' unconsciously. {nl}Neither of them were rich so these bets weren't ever that significant. Knowing this would trigger the curse, Modestas really wanted to ask Sigfried to leave. {nl}In the end, Modestas uttered these words: {nl}{np}Are you not busy? You seemed in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl} Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another 10 minutes or so. This horse might not seem like much, but when it comes down to it he can go pretty fast.' {nl}{np}Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl} 'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl} {nl} Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl} 'Do you not believe what I just said or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl} A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl} 'No, I didn't mean it like that......' {nl}{np}However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl} {nl} Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.{np}Considering Modestas' habit, to simply not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl} 'What...  what kind of bet?' {nl} 'We were going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl} Modestas desperately fought his inner gambler.{np}On the other hand, Sigfried was understandably confident, knowing with certainty that he would win the gamble, and was alright with betting his horse. {nl}With only a little money at hand, the bet became too good to refuse, and Modestas finally accepted. {nl}And, as expected, Modestas won. {nl}{np}As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}{np}As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.{np}For Modestas, who had always been elated upon winning bets and depressed upon losing them, to win and feel depressed was a first in his entire life. {nl}{np}Knowing he had just deceived his long-time gambling friend, Sigfried, and also missed an opportunity to earn a lot of money, Modestas felt conflicted as he walked slowly alongside the horse he had just won. {nl}While walking, Modestas remembered the earlier warnings of his unconditional bet. He realized that now, with his upcoming defeat, he was doomed to not earn any more silver than he started with.{np}While walking along the road, Modestas encountered a group of soldiers. {nl}Upon looking closer, the soldiers seemed to be arguing about what to buy at a store. {nl}Modestas decided not to interfere and pass them, but the soldiers noticed him and called. {nl}{np}You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl} Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl} Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl} 'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}{np}Modestas was surprised when he heard the word, 'gamble', but was relieved to know he was only being asked to referee. After all, nothing could possibly happen if he was just refereeing. {nl}Modestas learned that the soldiers were fighting over which goddess was the best. {nl}{np}What started as a small banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every goddess got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}{np}Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best goddess is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever goddess he supported. {nl}{np}The soldiers did not tell Modestas who voted for which goddess, for fear of his decision being affected by the expressions of each individual soldier. {nl}The soldiers did tell him however, how much they have each wagered. Just by seeing the gold nuggets, he could easily figure that there was a large amount of money in this bet. {nl}{np}Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his favorite goddess. {nl}{np}When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl} There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}{np}Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four goddesses but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five goddesses.' {nl}Then the soldiers resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}{np}The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave them. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him.{nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}{np}In Modestas' mind, he concluded that the quarrelling soldiers didn't have him referee, but simply added him into the bet. In reality however, he had no real claim, so he wasn't in the bet just yet. {nl}{np}Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join.{np}Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating in the soldier's bet, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}{np}In addition, because the other soldiers had already bet deeply, Modestas had to bet the only gold bullion he had. {nl}{np}If you think about it, even if it was his turn to lose, all it took for him to lose was one more vote for any of the goddesses he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his goddess being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}{np}However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. A commanding officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which goddess he favored. {nl}{np}The officer inadvertently said the name of a goddess, and some of the soldiers began cheering. {nl}The officer, not knowing what was going on, simply ordered his soldiers to move along. In any case, Modestas certainly lost. {nl}{np}Having now lost the gold bullion given to him by the strange old woman, Modestas was now at a loss. {nl}To originally intend to referee, only to end up losing all the gold he had, all while knowing exactly the reason why... Modestas felt heartbroken, dumbfounded, and yet, understanding. A unique feeling. {nl}{np}Although Modestas had just lost money by entering a bet started by others, it was the first time he'd done so in his life. Modestas spent some time thinking of how to better his situation and {nl}suddenly got an idea, knowing he was certain to win his next bet. {nl}{np}If he could call back the soldiers from earlier and bet his horse, he could certainly earn his gold back and possibly more. {nl}Knowing this, Modestas got on his horse, and sped in the direction the soldiers left towards. {nl}{nl}With speed, Modestas soon spotted a stationary wagon. Modestas lowered his speed to check out the wagon parked on the side of the road. {nl}{np}Unfortunately, just as Modestas pulled up at the wagon, his horse suddenly grew agitated, forcing him off. Fortunately, because he had cut his speed and fell on muddy ground, he was not greatly injured. {nl}{np}Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down hurt and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}{np}'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}{np}It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas had to ride the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}{np}Modestas could see that the wagon was very durable, good-looking and has been well cared for. However, he had no immediate need for a wagon, so he hesitated. {nl}In addition, Modestas had no money now; no matter how low the wagon owner went, he did not have the money to buy it. {nl}{np}The human heart sure can be an amusing thing. {nl}Modestas, deciding the wagon was worth buying but lacking the money to do so, decided he could use his impending victory to win the wagon for free. {nl}So he proposed a bet with the wagon master, risking his own horse. {nl}Naturally, Modestas won. {nl}{np}Modestas, having now just won a wagon and an injured horse, originally intended to keep just the wagon and his original horse. {nl}But seeing as the injured horse wasn't as injured as he thought, he believed he had won big. {nl}{np}In his mind, now that he'd had obtained two horses and a wagon, he believed he was no longer in a bad situation, deciding this time to be very careful not to lose big next. {nl}So, instead of following the soldiers, he decided to go to a place where there was less people. He reined his horse and traveled away from civilization. {nl}However, even in a remote setting, he was bound to meet others. {nl}{np}Rare as it would be, Modestas, while moving about in a uninhabited mountain, encountered an elderly Alchemist. {nl}The old Alchemist sat on a chair on the right side of the road, a silver nugget in hand. {nl}As Modestas passed by for a closer look, the nugget turned out to not be of silver, but of lead. {nl}{np}'Could this Alchemist be one who could turn lead into gold?' thought Modestas, but soon thought he was just overestimating the Alchemist. {nl}But the Alchemist, glad to see someone pass by after a long time, called out to Modestas, and suddenly proposed a bet with him. Somehow, the whole world today seemed to want to make bets with Modestas, and he was getting tired of it. {nl}Modestas liked gambling, but to find opponents this easily was becoming a joke to him. {nl}{np}Modestas was about to do something unlike his being and reject the bet, but the idea that he could wager low moved his mind. {nl}After all, the old Alchemist was wagering a lead nugget. {nl}{np}Because he was certain to lose this time, Modestas believed it would be better to wager and lose against a lead nugget now than to run into people who would wager a large amount of money, and lose later. {nl}Modestas first made sure that he could accept the bet despite having no money at hand and could bring some later, and accepted the bet. No words need to be said about the result. {nl}{np} Modestas admitted defeat and said he'd pay him pay back. As he was leaving the place with wagon in tow, the old alchemist broke into a strange smile that caught Modestas' attention.{np}And right before his eyes, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and in a moment clearly became gold. {nl} The old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget, be sure to bring it.' {nl} Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}{np}Instead, it was clearly gold, so in the end Modestas had bet and lost against a gold nugget. {nl}A now-tired Modestas ultimately had no way of objecting to the Alchemist. {nl}{np}Now, Modestas had lost more gold than he owed the strange old woman. {nl}And now, he only had one unconditional victory and defeat left. {nl}As Modestas lead his wagon through the rest of the mountain path, he murmured about having to make sure his next win was a very big one. {nl}{np}This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest, well maybe not the richest, but a wealthy man at the very least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}{np}Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The heavy deep voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}{np}You are... the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land for my sierra stretches far. Further in me I contain large valuable lodes.'{nl}{np}Hearing about the mountain's valuable lodes revived Modestas' habit. He even knew that this time, he was certain to win. Modestas started persuading the self-proclaiming mountain to make a bet with him. The mountain, unconcerned over winning or losing this bet, agreed. {nl}{np}For a person to have a fateful encounter with a mysterious being like this, even Modestas doubted his own sanity. {nl}In any case, Modestas bet against the mountain's ores, and won.{nl}{np}At the end of the bet, the mountain erupted, and a large boulder landed directly in front of Modestas. It was certainly something, but the boulder didn't seem to be what Modestas expected. For the mountain, this was the gambling debt repaid. {nl}In Modestas' eyes however, there should have been veins of gold, or at least something useful, like copper or coal. {nl}{np}Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a large quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed.{nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'{np}Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to his former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance to just win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}{np}And then suddenly, anxiety struck him. He realized that, although he has an unconditional loss upcoming, given the strange things that happened up to now, he would not be able to easily control the outcome of the final bet. {nl}Nonetheless, Modestas knew he couldn't stay where he was right now, and decided to leave. {nl}{np}Modestas got up and tried to move the boulder, but to no avail. It was simply too large for him to handle by himself. {nl}He considered leaving it behind, but after recalling the mountain's saying that the boulder was worth more than his two horses and wagon combined, he believed that would be a waste. {nl}Supposing he could sell the boulder to a local quarry for a good amount of money, he became troubled and unable to leave. {nl}{np}In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet, the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman asked Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}{np}Modestas confessed he was far from making profits, instead being in debt, and he had wasted all his chances to win and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman flatly added, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble but he was not the type to throw a tantrum nor was he a sore loser.{np} Modestas knew these gambles were more than just about money. {nl}Modestas, a dedicated gambler, nodded along with the woman's words.

I plan on telling him that, if a church is to be built behind such secrecy, it might be wiser to create something new rather than follow an old style.{nl}He seems to favor the look of Maven's Great Cathedral, however, so I don't believe he will reconsider.

I can't be certain due to the lack of records, but I don't believe a king as ever lived, or will live, to rule as long as Nachel III.{nl}While not as peaceful as the reign of Sawsel I, few are those who remember his era. Regular folk are bound to think of this as the first true period of peace in the kingdom.{nl}{np}{nl}Some day in the year of 876 of our Kingdom{nl}-{nl}It seems Owyn Dilven, unable to refuse our former king, has at last taken up the position of royal wizard, he who was so keen on declining the role...

He is indeed the quintessential wizard of our times, as well as the court's elite wizard. He may be almost 100 years short of practice, but his skill is enough to rival my own.{np}{nl}If the two of us were to battle, however,{nl}I certainly don't think he would be a match for me.

Another time, she developed a plan to overthrow a demon lord's grandiose and cruel plans to hurt humanity by signing a contract.{nl}In the end, she eradicated the demon lord entirely and became the sole person, aside from the goddesses and other transcendental beings, to ever enter the Fantasy Library.

690056,DCAPITAL103_BOOK3,A history book obtained after helping Investigator Horatio. It appears to be about the interactions between the Kedoran Merchant Alliance and the demons. Right-click to read.,icon_item_collection_03blue,,,,,,Barconsi and the Gold Vein Goblin,1,"This story takes place in the time of King Taniel I.{nl}While never recorded as part of the history of the kingdom, this tale was passed down in documents belonging to the Kedoran Merchant Alliance until 150 years ago, during the reign of King Wardel, when it became registered in the royal archives.{np}{nl}The story is believed to have been registered{nl}by archivists of the time under the assumption that it was merely a folktale.{nl}I, for one, would say otherwise. Thinking about this story at the time of the millenary, 50 years after the reign of King Wardel, I can't help but wonder if it isn't in fact a record of true events. {np}{nl}Year 1002 of the Kingdom{nl}By Royal Recorder Dena Jonas{nl}There stood Barconsi, head of the Kedoran Merchant Alliance, fearless before the enraged demon.{np}{nl}Ever so brazen, he confronted the demon.{nl}[I told you before and I'll tell you again.{nl}Are you so keen on disregarding the words of humans?{nl}The gold veins of this mountain belong to the Kedoran Merchant Alliance.]{np}{nl}Rumpelstiltskin was more than bewildered{nl}by Barconsi's audacious stance.{nl}[I have lived for many, many years,{nl}but never have I seen a human so impertinent.]{nl}[What good is it, really?{nl}I am telling you the gold veins are ours.]{np}{nl}[I'll concede you partial rights to them{nl}as fellow explorers of the mountain. But claiming they are all yours doesn't make the slightest sense. You have no way to prove you were the first to find the gold veins.]{np}{nl}To this, Barconsi replied:{nl}[What you say is true, and I will not try to prove it. On the other hand, are you sure that finding something first grants you the rights to it? I can't seem to remember any such laws existing.{np}{nl}Furthermore, my philosophy as head of the Alliance is that the way one uses wealth is more important than how one earns it. Based on that, I believe it is only right for us to keep this gold, as we would give it the most proper use. In other words, you may have claimed the beginnings,{nl}but we will claim the end.]{np}{nl}[How is that anything more than absolutely groundless?]{nl}[You, my friend, are the one known for fooling others with your twisted logic. It doesn't sound{nl}like you have any authority to accuse me of groundless arguments, wouldn't you say?]{np}{nl}Rumpelstiltskin tried as he could to calm himself, not wanting to show any signs of backing down. A few moments passed before he took a step back and spoke.{nl}[Very well. What are your plans for the gold, then?]{nl}[I don't see a reason to tell you what we will be doing with our gold, but if you insist... What will you give me if I tell you?]{nl}[Why would I give you anything?]{nl}[I'm the head of a merchant alliance. You didn't think you could get information from me for free, did you?]{np}{nl}Rumpelstiltskin, for a brief moment,{nl}break the centuries-old tradition and crush this insolent human. However, his even greater love of a good fargument brought his spirit up. He in turn, welcomed such a fearless challenger in ages.{nl}[Alright, I will tell you what I would be do with the gold when I obtain the gold vein.]{np}{nl}At that point, Baroconsi replied.{nl}[Huh? Are you trying to purchase our gold?]{nl}[What do you mean?]{nl}[Like I have said before, you don't listen, do you? You said you will tell me what you are going to do with the gold veins when you obtain them. Obtaining implies that you are not in possession of the object. Am I right?]{np}{nl}What he has just heard turned his stomach around once more{nl}but decided to endure it and asked again.{nl}[These gold veins shall be used to build the walls around the capital of the Kingdom.]{nl}[Ah that plan of Taniel a human king.]{np}{nl}[You are correct. We will use the gold from these veins{nl}as our fund and start a business of selling supplies and building materials to the Kingdom and make profit from the practice.]{nl}[If that is your purpose, I can never let you have them.]{np}{nl}[If that is your answer.{nl}let's settle this through a game or a bet that you love so much.]{nl}Once the word 'game' came out, Rumpelstiltskin's eyes gleamed with interest.{nl}[A game. I admit, you got my interest. I must warn you I rarely lose in games.]{np}{nl}Once Baroconsi heard this. he replied.{nl}[Since you are so confident, it wouldn't matter if I choose the game right? Since you are good at everything.]{nl}[It doesn't bother me.{nl}Let's start already.]{np}{nl}[Okay. Let's. As for the game,{nl}how about we ask each other questions about the veins. A true owner of these veins must be able to answer without any hesitation, right?]{np}{nl}Rumpelstiltskin thought about the proposal for a moment.{nl}The opponent is a human who have just discovered them. There was no way a powerful demon like him{nl}could ever be beaten by an ordinary human. He accepted the proposal.{nl}[Alright. I like it. Go on.]{np}{nl}Once Rumpelstiltskin accepted the idea, a further discussion on some ground rules and details went on and finally they reached an agreement. One of the terms was one could ask three questions to the other. Baroconsi started his question.{nl}[How many carriages would be needed to transport all of the gold in these veins?]{np}{nl}A powerful demon like Rumpelstiltskin{nl}could not even begin to fathom the answer even if he had clairvoyance, he wouldn't be able to answer it.{np}{nl}He thought about it but after a while, he figure{nl}even Baroconsi would not answer this question so he gave up. His reasoning was{nl}if Baroconsi doesn't know the answer as well, the round is a draw.{np}{nl}But as soon as Rumpelstiltskin gave up, Baroconsi answered{nl}[One carriage as big as these veins would certainly carry all the gold. So the answer is one.]{np}{nl}This, of course, infuriated Rumpelstiltskin and protested that that was not fair.{nl}Baroconsi did not even flinch and silently started at the giant demon who can easily squahs him with a tip of his finger.{np}{nl}Rumpelstiltskin eventually calmed down a bit. It was not in his nature to stop a game once it started. Furthermore, he took great pleasure from defeating his opponent no matter the circumstances or conditions. So he continued.{np}{nl}Baroconsi asked another question{nl}[My second question is this. You and I guess the amount of gold these veins would produce in a year and the one to guess the closest wins this round.]{np}{nl}At the question, Rumpelstiltskin added.{nl}[This time no trick with the scales. I will not tolerate such cheap trick anymore. And if you still do, I win.]{np}{nl}Baroconsi stared at Rumpelstiltskin straight in the eyes.{nl}Showing no sign of fear. {nl}Even when standing before a demon with infernal flame coming out of his head and razor sharp teeth gleaming with cruelty.{nl}[I give you my word on it. No scale trick this time.]{np}{nl}[I wil go first this time.{nl}By human technology, the amount of gold that can be mined from these veins will be the same as the amount of 17,200 people can carry. With a margin of error of 3 people. If you say a number close to what I have just said and claim that your number is closer. I will take that as a forefeit.]{np}{nl}Baroconsi replied.{nl}[I am not quite sure how that would make it a win for you but it's irrelevant for I have a different number. My number is 0.]{nl}[What?]{np}{nl}[0. Nil. Nada. To be more precise,{nl}for next year, the veins will not yield any gold. 0 of any scale is still 0.]{nl}[That only applies if you are in charge. If I am the master, I can simply make that answer incorrect by taking a small chunk right now!]{nl}[Be my guest, if you can.]{nl}[What makes you think I can't?]{np}{nl}[Well, you have a habit of not listening to other people.{nl}I have already told you that the Kedoran Merchant Alliance has the ownership of these gold veins{nl}and the Alliance always back its claim with evidences. Simply put we were aware of this place long before you came along.{nl}Frankly, we were waiting for you to arrive.{np}{nl}We have set up a barrier that no demon can ever cross{nl}The barrier will last for a year from now.{nl}That means you cannot ever touch the gold here.{nl}These facts make my guess not a guess but an accurate answer.]{np}{nl}[I will not have it. The second question is null.{nl}Or at least a draw.]{nl}Baroconsi did not argued with the demon's claim at all and continued.{nl}[Alright, the round is a draw. That means the next question will be a tie-breaker. I asked the questions twice in a row, so, it's only fair you do the question.]{np}{nl}Rumpelstiltskin was puzzled by his calm acceptance.{nl}But he did get what he wanted and it was his turn to ask. so his mind quickly became occupied with making a question. He thought about it for a moment and asked{nl}[Who will be the owner of these gold veins in one year?] {np}{nl}The question was immediately followed by a stern warning from Rumpelstiltskin.{nl}[If you say the Kedoran Merchant Alliance or any other person or entity, I will devour every single one of you. Of course, such task could not be done instantly.{np}{nl}but a year worth of time is enough. Enough to end you{nl}or any other fool who dares to claim the ownership. That fear would spread and the fools will stop. Besides, the barrier you claimed to have put will be over by then. No matter what the circumstance is the answer is absolute and only one. Isn't it?]{np}{nl}Rumpelstiltskin glowing with a sense of victory looked at{nl} Baroconsi. The countenance of Baroconsi did not alter at all. As if to show he has been expecting the demon's answer all along simply answered.{np}{nl}[The owner of the gold veins in one year's time would be you,{nl}Rumpelstiltskin.] Rumpelstiltskin was somewhat troubled by lack of disappoinment in Baroconsi's face but was joyous and said.{nl}[Yes, you admitted yourself. I am the owner of this place! So I win! Haha!]{np}{nl}[Not necessarily.]{nl}[What do you mean?]{nl}[I win two rounds and one was a draw. The score is 2 to nil. We won the game and we are the owner of this place.]{np}{nl}The demon countered. {nl}[Even if that is true, you've said it yourself, I will be the master in one year. That means, the gold veins become mine.{nl}And furthermore, you are bound by your own words that you will not be able to mine any gold from here. That means, I de facto own them.]{np}{nl}[Indeed. Now, let's get down to business.{nl}Literally. Let's negotiate.]{nl}[What's the meaning of this?]{np}{nl}[Business negotiation. We, the Kedoran Merchant Alliance, will sell you{nl}this gold mine to you for a price.{nl}Name your price right, we will even disable the barrier. That could technically make the amount of gold extract more than 0, as we've previously established.{nl}The result of this game might change but that's just a simple paradox puzzle...]{np}{nl}Rumpelstiltskin saw the man, Baroconsi, before his very eyes{nl}talking quite vaguely about pros and cons of the deal, the method of the transaction and a simple logical solution to the simple paradox puzzle mentioned before. The demon said to himself.{nl}[Contrary to what you've said, perhaps I am too trusting of people's words.]{np}{nl}Not much is known how the deal went down exactly.{nl}According to one version of the story, Rumpelstiltskin paid a massive amount of silver to the Kedoran Merchant Alliance and bought the gold mine. The demon did not touch the gold for he considered the deal to be his defeat.{nl}Rumpelstiltskin who has been almost unbeatable in a game or a bet had only three losses. This story was his first and the last was with Lydia Schaffen.{nl}As it is known by many, after the game with Lydia Schaffen, Rumpelstiltskin became unable to win or lose, not even participate in a game.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,0.0

I will not hesitate to take you down.]{nl}{np}Kartas slowly lowered his head, signaling to Giltine his obedience. No words were directed to Gesti.{nl}If needed, she would call for Kartas or his subordinates. He may not have been as brilliant as Baiga, but Gesti was no fool either. She would be careful not to assign Kartas too big of a role, or push him to the point of releasing his explosive nature.{np} Gesti pondered on what task she could entrust to Kartas.

To make matters worse, there was always the chance of an extended war with Lydia and her Schaffenstar organization, which would require constant supply of demon soldiers and trusted officials to command them.{nl}Assembling demon subordinates was an arduous task, even for a demon lord. Hauberk was right when he touted over and over again that demons needed better systematization of their orders. No demon should be without association, he had said.{np}Unfortunately, being thorough was not in their nature. Orders were given by whichever high-rank official was nearest, so subordinates simply fell under the control of whomever they preferred. The Creator had provided them and the goddesses with enough freedom. It simply happened that the idea of systematization did not conform with their principles. More importantly, when the power of every demon was needed, they had Giltine.{np}For better or for worse, demons of all degrees answered to Giltine, although the situation did not call for her to mobilize the entire demon forces. They still saw systematization as ineffective and cumbersome, despite some, like Hauberk, believing otherwise.{nl}It took Solcomm longer than expected to gather demons for combat and sufficient minions to serve them.

Perhaps they could have found a solution for a simpler kind of holy water, but this substance was much more complex. It had been created with not only magic, but alchemistic and theological knowledge far too advanced to decipher in such a short time.{np}Observing the sacrifice of the first demons to come in contact with the lake taught them that it was part holy water, modified to react to demons and nothing else. They would have attempted to destroy the main devices powering the water's reaction, but getting to them involved passing through the lake's dangerous waters. Even without the interference of Schaffenstar's members, there was no way around it.{np} Solcomm certainly had his talented subordinates, but all Schaffenstar members were expert marksmen. Each demon would have been crossed by ten different arrows before they could even reach the lake's devices. Sure enough, even their most agile flying demons could not escape the tower's large ballista.{np} Next, he attempted an attack by ship. Despite its shallow appearance, the Starlit Lake hid in it an abyss of unknown depth. The Astral Tower had been magically built hovering above this abyss, with the path leading to the tower also constructed through magic means. The area containing the tower and its path had been built on floating magic stones, while the rest remained a normal lake. Solcomm's plan, then, was to attack the tower from the magic-free zones surrounding it.{np}Unfortunately, obtaining the ships he needed wasn't as easy as planned. Even with Pbeta in charge of gathering ships and volunteers to sail them, their numbers fell short, so Solcomm resorted to secretly contacting Premier Eminent for help. Eminent had been gathering tremendous wealth in the human realm and was able to support their endeavour. Thus the demons could finally set sail on the Starlit Lake.{np}Sailing aboard the ships, the demons avoided contact with the water. They sailed for a few moments without signs of the enemy. The lake did not seem protected by any naval forces. Upon reaching a certain point in the lake, a downpour of arrows suddenly began to fall onto the demons' ships, piercing holes and splashing the lake's harmful water on their bodies. Unable to save the ships, the demons were helpless as water continued to infiltrate through the holes.{np}The attack was not unforeseen, however.

He was certain that Schaffenstar would never let these people suffer. Based on recent battles, Solcomm figured that most ranged weapons in Astral Tower could not reach the lake village, and even if some magic attack reached the area, its effects would be greatly reduced. {np}After some sieges and scouting attempts, Solcomm learned this: Astral Tower is equipped with weapons that can strike down enemy ships. In order to make such defense possible, the lake was carefully divided into areas that have magical levitation stones to allow passage, as well as areas that were empty.{nl}Due to this, attacking the tower with ships was close to suicidal. It didn't matter whether the ships were filled with demons or humans. The ships would be destroyed.{np}To Solcomm's surprise, no one seemed to know how deep the lake was.

Even so, Solcomm had no other choice but to resort to an all-out attack. He couldn't just ignore the criticisms from his superiors, so he had to push on. Also, he had to try at least once.{np}While being very much aware that Schaffenstar will not lower their defenses, Solcomm kept his force from making hasty attacks, and gathered even more demons by pushing Pbeta.{nl}After Solcomm's failures were spread in the demonic world, Pbeta's job of recruiting demons became much more difficult, and she made sure to let Solcomm know of her difficulties.{nl}However, Solcomm was ready to push himself to  the end for the last time.{np}For more than six months, Solcomm prepared for his all-out attack. He didn't have enough flying demons, nor enough ships, but he had to make do by approaching the tower through the lake. {np}The magical levitation stones were floating in a way that shallow water still flowed over them. It was too shallow for boats, and still too deep for demons to cross.{nl}Lydia Schaffen made sure these stones were floating at the exact heights to make this possible. This also made Schaffenstar members' shoes wet all the time, but for demons, it was a deadly threat.{np}When there weren't any battles or training during the day, Schaffenstar's recruits removed moss and water plants from the stones with rakes.{nl}After that, they carefully walked to the edge and tossed the plants in the lake.{nl}These tossed plants eventually became food for creatures living in the lake, leading countless creatures to be gathered around the floating stones.{np}Schaffenstar recruits were strictly trained and taught where the edges were, and where it was safe to walk, because there was no end to the lake's depth.{nl}Their daily routine of removing plants was also helpful in drilling this information into their minds. Of course, seniors were always nearby to make sure absolutely no recruits accidently fell in the lake.{np}Such accidents were much more fatal than one would think.{nl}As mentioned before, creatures were always gathered around the edges of these stones.{nl}These creatures may seem harmless from above, but if someone were to fall over the edge, they would attack that person without any hesitation. A fall into the lake was almost impossible to survive.{nl}This was one of the biggest reasons that made attacking the tower from the lake very difficult.{nl}If the boats were to sink, the demons didn't have anywhere to swim to.{nl}Although they were strong enough to swim to the edges of these stones, those were the most dangerous places.{np}The parts of the lake that didn't have any magical levitation stones over them were much safer.{nl}Of course, this would only be true until the demons become exhausted from swimming and sunk below.{nl}However, the villagers under protection of Schaffenstar were mostly safe in these areas. You see, the plants that were fed to them weren't intended to be food, but rather, highly addictive substances.{nl}This was one of Lydia's defensive strategies.{np}Because of their addiction, most of the aggressive and carnivorous creatures stayed around these edges, and other fish could safely breed and grow their numbers. This hugely benefited the fishermen of the village.{nl}Although carnivorous creatures would sometimes return to the lake's center to find their prey, they would immediately return to the edges for more plants afterward.{nl}The fishermen ran into these creatures occasionally, but they always carried some dried water plants to toss in the water.{np}However, tossing these plants in the wrong places could lead to fatal accidents, so the Schaffenstar members warned the fishermen to do this only when necessary.{nl}In the end, since most of these plants were tossed near the edges, the most dangerous creatures just stayed there rather than chasing the fishermen.{np}All of these factors guaranteed that the walkable surfaces were kept clean.{nl}These clean surfaces were soon tainted by Solcomm and his minions during their march toward the Astral Tower.{np}They brought vast amounts of soil to pour over the stones, which made it safe for the demons to march.{nl}It is a textbook tactic to fill moats that surround castles, but in this case, the whole lake functioned as one giant moat. A siege that involved filling a whole lake like this was unprecedented.{nl}Thankfully for the demons, the water was shallow enough where they were, but they still had a long way to go.{nl}Also, they had to cover a wide surface to avoid incoming arrows from the tower.{np}Despite their fierce march, a whole day has passed without a single battle.{nl}This was peculiar, but expected at the same time.

While the projectiles were flying over them, the demons had no choice but to keep filling the lake.{np}Siege towers with roofs were brought to minimize the damage, but even such structures would fall to the continuous stream of projectiles.{nl}One positive outcome from all this was that the thrown rocks could be utilized to fill more parts of the lake.{nl}Because the Astral Tower was built on top of a lake, most traditional siege weapons were rendered useless.{nl}For example, digging tools for sieges couldn't be used, even if demons were capable of digging underwater.{np}Solcomm was indeed aware of the fact that Lydia Schaffen would be fully prepared for him.{nl}If his enemy was the lake, he was even prepared to bring an army the size of an ocean to swallow that lake.

All they did was staring at their feet while being attacked. Unsurprisingly, complaints began pouring out.{nl}Dying in a proper battle was much more preferable, and they are much more controllable during battles.{np}However, Solcomm's minions quickly grew tired doing nothing against the arrows and stones that were flying toward them.{nl}Even Pbeta's discontent toward Solcomm was growing.{np}Despite all this, his army finally reached the tower's entrance.{nl}Flying demons, who were occupied in shooting down the projectiles, could finally focus on attacking the tower.{nl}Although some demons had to keep filling the lake, the rest could march straight over the small amount of water. Finally, after several days have passed, they would have their proper battle.{np} Of course, streams of boiling water, stones, arrows, fire, and magic started pouring over the demons' heads when they got close enough. Most of the flying demons were hit by arrows soon after the battle began, and they fell on parts of the lake that weren't filled.{nl}Although it seemed like Solcomm was fighting a losing battle, it was still a battle.{np}Solcomm was ready to fight to his death, no matter the outcome. All of his demons were already on the lake, and Solcomm himself charged in front of his minions.{nl}Despite popular belief, there is no such thing as an impregnable castle.{nl}Even if all the siege attempts had failed, the defenders are bound to run out of resources without help from allies to attack the surrounding army. Sturdy weaponry and catapults are only there to buy enough time for that to happen.

It was the bow that killed the Demon Lord Ziburynas.{nl}A single arrow would be enough to kill Solcomm.{nl}Solcomm was well aware that she would be able to hit him with her arrow if he charged in front.{nl}Despite this, he had to do this to silence the resentment from his minions and superiors.{np}He could withstand the scolding from Gesti, but if she sent him back to Kartas, there would be no telling what he would do to Solcomm as punishment.{nl}Being tortured by Kartas was much worse than being killed by Lydia's arrows.{np}However, her arrow never came. Instead, she withdrew her arrow and said this: [Fools! You are standing over stones that are controlled with magic.]{nl}Her words could be clearly heard by Solcomm who was still quite far away.{nl}However, he did not understand the meaning behind her words. He was about to find out.{np}At that moment, the stones that Solcomm's army was standing on started trembling, and soon after, they started to sink below the lake.{nl}Even demons who generally remain calm in times of chaos started screaming.{nl}Water started pouring over the stones and burned every demon that was on them.{nl}Solcomm couldn't do anything but watch his minions burn and melt in water.{nl}It was then Solcomm finally realized that Lydia was waiting for his entire army to move on to the lake.{nl}The distance his army had to run would take days.{nl}Even his flying minions had to avoid rains of arrows to retreat.{np}When only a handful of demons made it out, Pbeta arrived with additional demons from the demonic world.{nl}Because Solcomm was too shocked to do anything, Pbeta calmed the survivors in his stead.{np}Based on the report made by Pbeta after this incident, these magical levitation stones cannot be raised or lowered easily.{nl}According to experts on magic, if the stones were moved like this once, it would take decades before being able to do so again.{np}However, at the very moment, Solcomm and Pbeta didn't have the time to think it through. All the construction done over the stones were destroyed,{nl}and Schaffenstar members took back what could be used as defensive weapons, and threw out the rest.{np}Some demons were sent to interrupt their operations, but it was too difficult to fight on the lake in the first place.

The only way to look was to lean down from the edge of the ship, an act too risky for any of the men on board to pursue.{np}They had not heard the small boat approach the ship, so whoever it was who was climbing that rope ladder, he would have had to swim his way back.{np}The small boat was far too distant for that to seem plausible, but it was even less likely that someone else had happened to approach the ship in those waters.{nl}The men on deck focused on the sounds of the climbing stranger, until a hand emerged and gripped the edge of the gunwale.{np}The hand was not familiar to them, perhaps form all the blood, sun and sea that washed over it on the long way to the ship.{nl}No one offered to help.{np}If, by any chance, that hand belonged to the rival captain, they did not want his crew to misunderstand it as an attempted attack.{np}Seadog and Oceanid remained silent, focusing their attention on the edge of the ship while signaling their crews to stay still.{nl}The hand gripping the gunwale trembled as it pulled up the heavy body of the stranger, revealing his face.{np}Nearly unrecognizable by his subordinates were Hayraven's features, mangled by multiple wounds and sheer exhaustion.{nl}Every pirate on the ship thanked Jurate for giving them the victor they so eagerly awaited.{np}Hayraven climbed over the gunwale and stood on the deck, looking at the men on each side of the ship before addressing them.{nl}[I grant you all permission to board my ship.]{np}He spoke as if he had been alone on the ship waiting for the others to board.{nl}That may not have been the case, but to sailors of all kinds, boarding permission was an important convention.{nl}It was also a sign that all of the crews' problems had been solved, as no man had any intentions to defy his authority.{nl}Knowing this, Hayraven spoke again.{nl}[The captain's cabin...]{np}Hayraven collapsed onto the deck before he could finish his sentence, and the pirates around him hurried to help.{nl}Old and new members of his crew laid the unconscious Hayraven down in the captain's cabin.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

Hayraven, opening his eyes, awoke from his shallow sleep. He had dreamt another of his many recurring dreams.{nl}At times finding himself on a small boat, facing an unfamiliar foe, or at others recalling events from his past. He would dream of endless rope ladders and ghost ships. Visions of his crew and Vladislovas' subordinates populated his subconscious; dreams that shifted but remained unchanged as well.{nl}{np}He put on his clothes and stepped out onto the deck, where he was greeted by his crew. Hayraven raised his hand in response as he walked, but was halted by the sight of Seadog approaching. {np}The latter looked up at the watchman stationed atop of the mast.{nl}Before Seadog could speak, the watchman cried out,{nl}[Mast sighted starboard!]{nl}Unaware of the fact that he would have been punished had his warning arrived only a second later, the watchman continued to shout.{np}[Merchant vessel! Flag unidentified!]{nl}He soon followed with more information.{nl}[Flag confirmed! It's a Kedoran Alliance vessel!]{nl}Hayraven nodded at Seadog, who understood his orders.{np}The captain, having spotted the approaching vessel long before the watchman, sat down on a deckchair and quietly observed his crew prepare for battle under Seadog's command. The merchant ship was now close enough for all the men on board to see. Seadog, who was standing next to the captain, muttered in surprise,{nl}[Huh. Who do we have here?]{np}Hayraven's eyes were also set on the group of heavily armed men on deck of the neighboring vessel.{nl}[Looks like Guerra's Pledge of the Blade mercenaries are on board.]{nl}Seadog spoke carefully.{np}[They don't seem to be shipping any cargo. If all they have are mercenaries, their ship will be light and fast. Seems to me like they should be counting on that to retreat as fast as they can now... Unlike the Golden Note mercenaries, they don't look like they travel with enough combat supplies, either.]{np}[Running away would taint their reputation; that can't be good for business. No, they're looking for a fight here. Let's grant their wish,] Hayraven concluded. [Do you reckon Guerra's involved?]{nl}[It doesn't look like he is, Captain.]{nl}Seadog shot another glance at the watchman, confirming the absence of any new reports. Hayraven spoke again.{nl}[Look at the way they're lined up. They're expecting hand-to-hand. They think I'm going to fight them their way, do they?]{np}[The Pledge of the Blade is known for the knives, but they should know their arrows, too.]{nl}Hayraven took Seadog's words lightly.{nl}[We're pirates; we start our fights from the ship, and if we can, we end them from the ship. Why let it escalate? It's not like we're fighting the Great Pirate Vladislovas now, is it?""{nl}Seadog acquiesced and began calling out the captain's orders to the crew in a sonorous voice.{np}Hayraven returned to his deckchair. The early stages of the battle were easy for Hayraven's side. The wind blew in the direction of the enemy, protecting his ship from the merchant vessel's arrows and allowing his crew to decimate a large part of the mercenary forces.{np}Yet, no strangers to the projectile attack themselves, the Pledge of the Blade used wide shields to defend their crews.{nl}However, they were at sea.{nl}If anyone had the knowledge to make the most of the factors at play, it was hayraven.{np}By controlling the movement of his own ship from its fortunate position, he made use of the wind and currents to tilt the enemy vessel to a nearly 45 degrees angle.{nl}{np}Not only were they now standing on a slope, the mercenaries had to maintain their balance over the continuous rocking of the waves, which to less seasoned sailors was no easy task.{nl}Once the Pledge's numbers were sufficiently reduced, hand-on-hand combat began.{nl}Seadog coarsely shouted the order at the pirates.{nl}[Hook them! Hook the Ship!]{np}Hayraven's subordinates hurried to swing their hooks into the enemy vessel. The mercenaries, in turn, bustled to and fro, cutting off the ropes attached to the priates' metal hooks using large two-handed swords.{np}Observing the mercenaries' fast response to his attack, Hayraven stood up from the deckchair.{nl}[They aren't playing, are they?]{nl}He ran to the edge of the ship and swung his own iron hook at the merchant vessel, striking an unknown mercenary across the chest. The hook went on to bury itself deep within the ship.{np}Another member of the Pledge ran towards Hayraven's hook brandishing his bayonet. Seeing him,{nl}the captain withdrew his pistol and aimed.{nl}One shot was all it took to blast away the mercenary.{np}Yet already another one was attempting to reach the hook. This time, the mercenary avoided the pistol shot, causing Hayraven to react with a smile of amusement.{nl}[Alright, this one knows what he's doing. Let's see you cut this, then!] As he spoke, Hayraven swung another hook at the enemy ship, one which the agile mercenary was unable to avoid.{np}Struggling to free himself from the hook, the man bore deep injuries as Hayraven pulled him through the waters between the two vessels.{np}The Keel hauling eventually took his life before the captain could pull him up onto the pirate ship.{nl}The two crafts drew closer and closer, and hayraven eagerly reached for the Jolly Roger.{np}[Did Vladislovas ever hit a hip with the Jolly Roger from this far?] he asked, grinning blithely.{nl}Seadog, who had been standing by the captain awaiting new orders, shook his head.{nl}[At this distance? Impossible.]{np}Hayraven replied.{nl}[That's right. For anyone else it is.]{nl}With this, he launched the pirate flag across the waters.Seeing the Jolly Roger lodge itself in the merchant ship, Hayraven called out to his crew.{np}[Go! Let them fear my flag! I'm giving twice the loot to the first pirate to slaughter a mercenary by the Jolly Roger!]{nl}Seadog followed with his own commands.{nl}[You heard the captain. The last man to get on that ship is riding the keel.]{np}The pirates dutifully complied, echoing each other's battle cries as they crossed over onto the merchant ship.{nl}The Pledge of the Blade were already behind their opponents in both number and morale, and having Hayraven himself join the combat only asserted their inevitable defeat.{np}The Pirate Captain's dust devil quickly spread terror among the last surviving members of the mercenary group, who promptly abandoned their weapons and surrendered.{nl}It wasn't long before Hayraven's subordinates executed the few who had dared to resist them.{np}Finally, the captain and crew of the merchant ship, who had been hiding in a corner of the vessel as the battle was held, were dragged out onto the deck.{nl}These sailors had been spared by the mere efficiency of Hayraven's powerful attacks.{nl}Had the conflict spread out across the entire ship, they were unlikely to have survived.{np}The pirate looked down at the captured crew before addressing them.{nl}[Are these all the men you have? I didn't think there'd be so few of you.]{nl}Their captain replied.{nl}[It is as Guerra requested, yes. The Alliance crew was reduced and the work was assigned to his mercenaries to decrease costs.{np}Not only was the ship mostly occupied by these mercenaries, we are also carrying a considerable amount of our own cargo. It was very difficult for us to sail in these conditions, you see. Guerra's men aren't familiar with the sea; I suppose that ultimately led to their defeat today.]{np}[According to your logs, the goods you're shipping are heavy but they aren't worth much. And you say you cut the freight charges, too. It sure doesn't sound like a good deal for the alliance.]{nl}[Before our encounter, Captain, the mercenaries were paying their passage as stipulated in the contract, tending to the weapons and cleaning the deck. As for the goods, they may not be worth much now, but surely you're aware of how we do business at the Kedoran Merchant Alliance. The original value of those goods will pose no problem. That is why...]{np}The captain of the merchant vessel stood up to adopt a bolder stance.{nl}[Should you release this ship, the crew and all of our merchandise in safety, I propose to write you a certificate. A document that guarantees you a generous fee from any branch of the Kedoran Alliance.{np}Our goods won't yield much profit to an untrained merchant. And as you see, our current personnel are far too scarce to be any help to you. Our only condition is that this ship arrives safely at its destination. Once that is confirmed, you're welcome to claim your reward.]{np}[So you're offering me a paper that's worth more than this ship, the cargo and a few crewmen. Is that right? And all I have to do is wait for you to dock and tell the Alliance to get my money?]{nl}[That is correct. I should say, our communication network is rather advanced; it won't take long for the information to reach all our branches.'{np}Hayraven pondered for a moment.{nl}[Alright. The Alliance always finds a way to avoid a loss, don't they? Dirtier than pirates, you are. Then, the rest of the filthy mercenaries will stay with us, yes? Everything they had on them, too.]{np}The captain of the Kedoran Alliance knew Hayraven was not asking for consent, and so he nodded in agreement.{nl}The surviving mercenaries and their belongings were moved to the pirate ship.{np}Oceanid approached Hayraven and asked,{nl}[Should we get the plank ready?]{nl}It was the custom in pirate ships to force captured enemies onto a plank laid on the side of the vessel and demand that they choose between joining the crew and drowning at sea.{np}Hayraven, however, shook his head.{nl}[Leave them be. I have a deal with Olfas Grimm. We'll gather a few more prisoners and sell them off to the Monk Master. Let them starve until they're weak enough, but not so much that they'll mutiny.]{np}The captain's orders were confusing, but Oceanid acceded and returned to the crew.{np}Hayraven was left to mutter to himself.{nl}[Guerra, you filthy rat. I hope you find me after this; maybe then I'll finally get myself a worthy fight.{np}This time we'll you our knives. Hmm. Come to think of it, they do day Creak is a match for Guerra. Who knows, it could be fun to fight Creak, too. Bore a bullet hole in his skull like I did to Vladislovas. He's not bad with his gun either, or so they say.]{np}At the end of his train of thought, Hayraven became silent. He raised his eyes to the silhouette of the merchant ship slowly disappearing in the horizon before turning back to the captain's cabin.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

Or a client too important not to be seen directly by him...{np}{nl}[Our guest has just arrived from the Polanyi territories.]{nl}[Pleased to meet you. My name is Yiltren, representative of the Polanyi territories.]{nl}Warsis stood up to greet him. Yiltrin returned the formal bow and prepared to address the Master.{np}Warsis figured that being forced to repeat what he had likely just told Paul all over again would at least bother him, but the man's expression remained calm and composed. Either his problem was urgent, or he was used to that kind of situation. His posture gave away no signs of restlessness, so Warsis concluded it was the latter.{np}[The former Duke of Polanyi divided the territories into three portions, which he passed on to each of his sons. Our land is now smaller and no longer united, but the three lords have always lived in relative harmony.{np}That is, until recently, when the eldest brother passed away with no heir of his own, and the land was once again divided. Each lord now owns part of their brother's land, but neither can agree on how to share it. It has gotten to the point where they're resorting to the use of force.]{np}The dispute itself was obvious to Warsis, but he was left wondering.{nl}[I understand that they would resist dividing the land in half out of greed, but any official diplomat of the Kingdom can certainly intervene. How did the situation escalate without the say of the government?]{np}[Official powers do intervene when there is a dispute between two noble families. The ministry will send officers to investigate and determine who is right, then take the measures necessary to enforce their decision. Unfortunately that is not the protocol for conflicts arising within nobles of the same family.{np}The ministry will not interfere unless a member of the family is suspected of a very grave crime, such as practicing cruel tyranny against the people of their land, colluding with the demons, or otherwise violating the sanctity of the goddess' divine grace.{np}As it is, matters concerning the sovereignty of a territory are the sole responsibility of the ruling lord or lords.]{nl}[Even if that's true, I do think an official diplomat should be able to issue a corrective order...]{np}[Well, yes, but it would take a serious infraction of the royal law in order for them to take any measures. There's never been a corrective order issued about territorial disputes. In fact, there's hardly ever been a situation considered grave enough to warrant a corrective order.{np}It simply cannot be done without a serious motive.]{nl}[I suppose they never punished any lords for misjudging their own governing abilities or famishing entire regions...]{nl}[Precisely. Incompetence does not justify the punishment of someone in the noble class. When the people disagree with their lord's decisions, they find a cleric to complain to, or they petition to the ministry in the capital. Otherwise, they simply live at the whims of their ruler, for better or for worse.]{np}[So your case is considered an internal issue and can't be solved through diplomatic action.]{nl}[Not only that, but since there is no heir, the residents prefer that one of the former Duke's remaining sons is made lord, rather than an administrative officer from the capital.{np}As you know, if a lord passes with no legitimate heir or has their noble title revoked as punishment, an officer of the Kingdom is assigned to manage the territory.{nl}That opens the possibility for another noble person to gain ownership of the land.{np}In any case, an administrative officer, as fair and benevolent as they may be, will only stay as long as their mandate. There is no telling what influence that might have on the region.{np}A long-term ruler is the better option, particularly considering that our former Duke is still very much revered by his people.]{nl}[Well, any lord can only rule because there is the law of the Kingdom above them. And with it, clerics that commune with the goddesses and interpret Their will.{np}The only difference, which you also mention, is that a lord can rule the same territory for longer. That is what keeps local government stable and consistent. I wouldn't say it's because lords are more competent than royal officers.]{np}[I very much agree. Our problem is that the land was divided in three not long after it was first united. The residents agree on a reunification, but the ministry has left the issue in the hands of the current rulers.]{np}[In all honesty, you should be thankful that they've given you power over this situation. So, are the two lords preparing for battle?]{nl}[No, sir. That is not what they want. But settling this dispute through words alone has proven impossible, which is why I came to request your help. Isn't this the kind of work you do, after all?]{np}[Hm, I see. They can't use their own people for battle. Any casualties and the royal officers will come knocking. Talking it out isn't going to work either, so they're looking to hire mercenaries to fight for them instead.{np}If that's all there is, was there a need to bring the client to me directly instead of accepting the order and reporting on it as usual? Paul?]{nl}The words were harsh in Paul's ears, but Warsis was used to relegating general requests to his partner and did not hesitate to scold him.{np}Paul's answer was simple.{nl}[The other side is employing the Pledge of the Blade, sir.]{nl}[Hah. So you thought I'd be scared of facing Guerra? Or do you just take pleasure in hearing a client say it to my face?{np}Doesn't matter. It's not every day you get the chance to stand against an expert like Guerra. We'll take the request. You can settle the details of the contract with my partner Paul.]{nl}Warsis directed a short bow towards their client, before turning around with a pleased smile.{nl}[This is going to be interesting.]",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

They were inside his barracks, sitting opposite each other on worn out wooden stools.{nl}[I'm afraid it is.]{np}The reply came from Lamin, a general of the Royal Army.{nl}[How?? Territorial disputes are under the jurisdiction of the ministry. Their officer Beikeol already declared that the problem is to be settled by the two parties, in consideration of the residents and the former Duke.{np}I'm well aware of the conditions. No damage to any property in the region, and no casualties on either side of the local armed forces.{np}So I have to insist: this is not the place for the Royal Army. Think about it. Your superiors won't be happy to hear you're interfering in a civilian dispute; that will only escalate the problem. Not to mention how it will look to His Majesty the King.]{np}[We have no intentions of defying the authority of royal officers or ministries. The same is true for the Royal Guard, our Royal Knights, and every other general of the Kingdom.]{nl}[Why is it that having you, General, say this in front of me only makes you sound less credible?]{np}[My men and I are officially off duty. In the meantime, we were given orders to search for territories around the Kingdom that can be used for military purposes.{np}This area of land has just lost its owner and it could be very useful to us. Naturally, we want it.{nl}Whether the ruling lords are at battle, or whether they hire mercenaries to fight for them is not of our concern.{nl}Territorial disputes aside, we are here to adapt this region for military use. That is our official stance.]{nl}Warsis Creek pondered on the general's words before replying.{np}[That's the army's position. Now I want to hear your personal opinion, General Lamin.]{nl}[Yes, to be honest, if it weren't for this dispute we wouldn't have come here under the pretext of using this land for the army.]{nl}Lhamin paused for a moment before speaking again.{nl}[Mr. Creek.]{np}Intrigued to hear the general call out his name, the Schwarzer Reiter Master adjusted his position, leaning lower towards the table.{nl}Lhamin waited until he was sure he had Warsis' undivided attention.{np}[I'll be frank with you. I know I'm overstepping my authority coming here. I know I have no right to stand in the way of official orders, but I was not sent here by my superiors. I'm keeping an eye on Olfas Grimm and Aleister Crowley. I'm also worried that something might provoke the folks in the Astral Tower to launch an attack.{np}Those are all real threats to the safety of the Kingdom.{nl}But the Royal Army isn't allowed to take action without sufficient reason. And we can't give away the fact that we're paying attention to these issues. Only when something happens can we intervene.]{np}[Well, isn't it your duty as general of the Royal Army? Following the orders of your superiors and the Royal Court when trouble happens?]{nl}[Need I remind you that you abandoned a bright career as general of the Kingdom to pursue your own military endeavors, Mr. Creek? If anyone should sympathize with my position, I would expect that to be you.]{np}[So you believe that waiting until the Court commands you to act is more damaging to the Kingdom, and you can't stand waiting in the dark. So you'll do whatever it takes to prevent something serious from happening, as long as it's not strictly against royal law.]{np}[Correct. I believe it's my duty as general of the Kingdom to use any resources at my disposal to protect the nation and its people.]{nl}[Good. I agree with you, General. Although I don't think I would describe my military career as ""bright"". Yours, on the other hand...]{np}[I'm afraid there are many talented and more experienced generals above me, Mr. Creek.]{nl}[Come on, General, there's no need to be humble. Tell me what you want.]{np}[Ministry officer Beikeol is a very intelligent man and an outstanding bureaucrat. Some even say he's set to become the next Premier Eminent.{np}But something about his behavior changed in the past few years. It's not enough to incriminate him, but it has caught my attention. Like this territorial dispute, for example. The locals who remember the original Duke want their land to be ruled by either one of his remaining sons.{np}The officer agreed to let the two lords settle things on their own, so long as the conflict doesn't escalate too far. This all seems fairly reasonable, until you consider...]{nl}[... that the scale of this whole confrontation wouldn't be nearly as serious if the lords hadn't hired the Pledge of the Blade and the Golden Note to fight in their behalf. Regardless of the outcome, the responsibility is ours and the residents'.{np}Do you think the officer was trying to aggravate the conflict? There's no proof of it, of course, but is that your suspicion?]{nl}[Incisive as always, Mr. Creek. Not only is there no proof of the officer's intentions, but his reasoning is almost undeniably correct.{np}Also, I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that two Class Masters and two rival mercenary groups are involved.]{nl}[I can see why. Now, this isn't entirely related, but I'm curious about your work with the Astral Tower and the other Masters. I understand you're paying close attention to them.]{np}[As a Master yourself, you know that Class Masters are treated like nobility even if they aren't of the noble class. After all, it's an important position one gains by having their talent recognized. The problem is when one of those highly talented people uses their skill or authority for personal reasons.{np}I simply think that Masters who show that disposition should be monitored.]{nl}[There are much more despicable people among our Class Masters. Corsair Master Hayraven, for example.]{nl}[It was His Majesty, King Lomel who assigned high positions to pirate captains of the time to increase the numbers of the Royal Navy, and gave them the symbolic token that is passed on from Master to Master. It was an unfortunate decision that we should be trying to rectify.{np}It isn't right for us to continue allowing the pirates to use their contributions of eight centuries ago as an excuse to maintain their importance and appoint their own Masters.]{nl}[Revoking their right to the royal token is nearly impossible now.{np}The token was always taken from the previous Master through means of skill, and His Majesty, King Kadumel declared 600 years ago that the position of Class Master is to be merited by skill. No king has been able to invalidate the token after that, and now it's in Hayraven's hands.{np}Whether we like it or not, the token proves that he is recognized by the Kingdom.]{nl}[King Kadumel's legacy isn't the brightest, unfortunately.]{nl}[Any reasonable person will agree, but that's not what we need to focus on.]{nl}[How I regret not being able to handle Hayraven myself.]{np}[And you say you're worried about the Astral Tower? That's unexpected. The Schaffenstar have been strong allies of the Kingdom for centuries, and Mcen doesn't seem all that bad.]{nl}[Yes, I very much admire their long tradition and dedication. Their leader Mcen is also exceptionally talented and good-natured.{np} However, the Schaffenstar are more numerous than ever and they're incredibly skilled. Not only that, they have autonomous rights. They may follow the values of their founder Lydia Schaffen now, but there's no guarantee that that will always be the case.{np}From a military point of view, if the Schaffenstar were to declare themselves as an independent territory with the Starlit Lake as their borders, there is little the Kingdom could do about it. ""There is no such thing as an impenetrable fortress, and even the strongest ones are destined to fail without consistent support from the outside""...]{np}[Glkahn Donihue, The Theory of War Vol. 3.]{nl}Lamin looked almost serene as he nodded knowingly at Warsis. The general continued.{np}[Unlike what the great General Donihue believed, however, impenetrable fortresses do exist. The Astral Tower is proof of that. It transcends theory, really. The only possible way to conquer it would be to wait for all the Schaffenstar members to grow too old to sustain the tower.{np}Not even if a miracle of the goddesses brought back all the great generals of King Zachariel would there be another way to bring it down by force.]{np}[The way I see it, all it takes is an act of treason to weaken the entire foundation of a society like them.]{nl}[Yes, historically it wouldn't be the first time it has happened. The problem is that there isn't much else we can hope for in terms of a solution. As general of the Royal Army, I simply cannot be at ease knowing that an organization like this has the power to ignore our royal laws if they want to.]{np}[I understand, but let's not worry about things that haven't happened yet. We have our own problem to solve now, remember? What are you going to do about our dispute?]{nl}[From what I've observed, it seems like both you and Mr. Guerra aren't quite sure about what to do next.{np}You already settled your commission with the lords. Financially, you can't afford to drag the dispute for much longer. You fought a few battles with no sure victory, but scaling up the conflict means an even heavier burden on your funds.{np}Maybe it isn't my place to say this to the leader of a mercenary group, but if you've been fighting for this long with nothing but casualties and injuries to compensate for, isn't it time to agree on a cease-fire? Isn't that also part of your work?]{np}[I do not need you to explain my job to me. I understand very well that this situation needs to end if we're going make a profit from it. Guerra isn't the only one with an eye for money. Do you think I would be the leader of a mercenary group if I didn't know how to do business?]{np}[Very well. My request is simple, then. Leave. I know you need to return to the capital soon, to complete your contract with the arena and take in new men from their group of fighters. Surely you're not planning to miss that? You would be wasting the amount you spent on the deposit, not to mention the opportunity to integrate new mercenaries.{np}It's very important that you leave now. You may lose the bonus for retreating without a victory, but I'm sure you'll have agreed on a fair commission either way. And yes, you can count on extra compensation if you stay and win, but if your side is defeated, won't that result in twice the losses?{np} That is why you need to leave now. Take the path of less risk and abandon this conflict immediately.]{nl}[Financially, yes, that is the most sensible solution. But still...]{nl}[My soldiers and I will occupy the entire area where your mercenaries are located.  The Pledge of the Blade won't be able to attack us.{np} It's hard to imagine anyone defying the Royal Army. In fact, my soldiers and I would be happy if they tried. We would very much like the chance to face off against Guerra's men. It isn't something that happens every day, after all.]{np}[Would that be legally viable?]{nl}[We'll use force and pressure them to abandon their occupied territory. The ministry or the army will likely send someone to investigate. They'll go back and forth before they make the decision to send me the orders to retreat, but that will take time.{np}I'll receive a warning for misinterpreting the scope of my duty; nothing serious. If I'm lucky, my superior in the capital, General Vincentas, might even recognize this land for official military use.{np} If that happens, the two lords who hired you will just have to accept the situation. Of course, with the ministry in charge, things might not look good for me.{np}Prince Tylenis and Princess Kaonilla both have ties with some of my general friends in the Royal Army, so I don't believe they would let me get demoted over this incident. At most, I'm expecting a cut in my pay or some other kind of mild disciplinary action.]{np}[If you're already expecting that, why not go ahead and propose an expropriation of the disputed territory? Even if one of the lords ends up occupying the land, the profit from the crops can help fund the soldiers stationed in the area. It can't get more practical than that.]{np}[That's a good idea. We would never be able to do that in reality, but the absurd proposal is sure to make the two lords rethink their positions. If we can create a new plan to section the land, there's a chance they will consider it one final time.]{np}[I think Guerra should handle the agreement, in that case. I will already be gone by then, and Guerra can use his influence to settle the dispute and receive some added compensation from both lords.]{np}[Are you sure you're rivals? Hahah. That's incredibly generous of you, Mr. Creek.]{nl}[Let's keep it at that. I'll give my men orders to begin evacuating.

As a result, the Wizard society of this time was divided into union members and non-union members.{nl}And if compared, those of the union were stronger than those who were not.{nl}{np} There were worries that the the Clerics and other warriors who bore the strength of the goddesses would be overpowered or, if that was not the case, the union Wizards would overtake the country.{nl}If the organized Wizards were simply stronger and nothing more, then these rumors would not spread, but there were a small few within the union who clearly wished to use this strength for power.{nl}{np} On the other hand, there were Wizards who are either hermits or research-focused and act alone, separate from the union.{nl}As such, although those of the union did not seek for world domination, most of the Wizard societies' initiatives and proposals naturally went in favor of the union.{nl} {np} Concerns were raised about what would happen to the Wizard society if the union was left unattended.{nl}Although the concerns were few, it was those with wisdom who brought the issue before the Kingdom, thus marking it as a crisis.{nl}{np} Thus began King Jusel's official support of non-union Wizards.{nl}Through official policies, his government provided financial support for their research and livelihood.{nl}In retaliation, union Wizards sold their magic at a more expensive price, making it harder for mercenaries and others to gather funds.{nl}{np} Yet those who were not part of the union were mostly researchers and hermits, while those who were part of the union more actively and systematically sold their products to the noble families. This allowed them to build a wider circle of connections.{nl}As such, King Jusel could not prevent the contracts and transactions that occurred between his Kingdom's subjects.{nl}{np} However, there were more complicated measures, such as adding a new tax regulation to cut into the union's profits and to move the non-union members into friendlier relationships with the royal family while slowly reducing the amount of union shops.{nl}Through these methods the government and the nobles were forced to invite non-union members and as a result the measures were thought to be a success.{nl}{np} As these events unfolded, the union members were able to protest, but it had reached a point where even that had become difficult.{nl}There was nothing more for them to do except to retaliate.{nl}{np} There were those who did not like that the work had been passed on to non-union Wizards, but if the situation resulted in a rebellion they were more than likely to side with the royal family. And they would have to deal with Clerics, who had the power of the Goddesses with them and the royal families and their soldiers. Along with that, it is possible that many members would leave the order.{nl}{np} More importantly, there was no pretext for a rebellion.{nl}But the alliance did not stop there, and instead thought of a different method.{nl}They demanded an independent self-governing domain within the borders of the Kingdom.{nl}If they could not be leaders of the world, they would at least make the brightest city known to man.{nl}{np} Although their intentions were inpractical, King Jusel had no way of preventing their request.{nl}As this was legally similar to the lands that the noble families ruled on their own.{nl}{np} The alliance through various means gathered the funds necessary to purchase a plot of land. When their representative went before the Royal family to register as leader, the Royal family, taking comfort in the fact that if a situation should arise then only those in that domain would feel its effects, accepted.{nl}{np} The alliance gave their new city the name Nicopolis.{nl}It wasn't long before Nicopolis saw success.{nl}As they were all gathered in one place, their efficiency saw new heights and they were able to produce magic scrolls and items that produced better effects at a cheaper cost.{nl}{np} The Royal family were also pleased by the successes of Nicopolis and funds from the tax increased.{nl}And with this change, they no longer had the burden of supporting the non-alliance members.{nl}If the Wizards of Nicopolis kept to themselves, then all would be well and prosperous.{nl}{np} But as we already know, this is not how things played out.{nl}To this day, the events of Nicopolis are still unknown, but the Wizards of the city were known to dabble in unprecedented magic. The side effects of which caused not only the alliance Wizards but all the citizens of Nicopolis to disappear.{nl}{np} One hypothesis is that their disappearance was the result of a failed attempt to enhance their magic to its highest potential. As the side effect had no impact on the buildings of the city, we will not be able to know what exactly they were and where are those who were affected.{nl}{np} The city was deserted, yet despite the passing of time the buildings of the city showed no signs of decay, remaining the same as the time it was built. All because of the magic that encased it.{nl}{np} Later, as fear of the city slowly began to disappear, it was used by migrating citizens of the Kingdom and remained a fairly normal city until Medzio Diena.{nl}But the magic of the city became a burden to the citizens when the calamity that was Medzio Diena struck.{nl}{np} It's still not known as to why, but compared to Fedimian and other cities, Nicopolis faced the most damage, causing those who lived there to desert the city in considerable numbers.{nl}After Medzio Diena, most citizens of the Kingdom fled to safer lands, yet it is said that there are still some who remained to make use of the more advanced equipment of the city.{nl}{np} According to rumors, monsters have now gathered at the city and it's recommend that those who have no place being there, should avoid it.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

The original material on which it was written may look like paper, but it behaves very differently from any common type of paper, a trait which continues to baffle bibliographers to this day.{np} I personally suspect that this document may originate from Goddess Vaivora's Fantasy Library.{nl}{np} I am certain that this document – and, by extension, records of it – did not exist before Medzio Diena. If it is true that Medzio Diena affected not only our world but the Fantasy Library as well, it is my theory that a Revelator may have entered the Library, causing some of its contents to cross over to our world as consequence.{nl}{np} Unfortunately, the excerpt transcribed below is the only section of the document that has been recovered so far. We can only hope that its remaining parts will one day surface.{nl}- Year 1096 of the Kingdom{nl}Sage Master Lufas Kehel{nl}{np} Enveloped in the familiar chill of the stones, Duke Kamof passed through the gateway. After all the workers had been sent away by order of the king, the room felt even cooler.{nl}The absence of humidity, if anything, confirmed to him that the structure had been built as intended.{nl}{np} The mausoleum needed to remain free of humidity to avoid damaging its inner constructions. No one knew how many eras the structure would have to last, which meant that every detail required the utmost attention.{nl}{np} With these thoughts crossing his mind, the duke hurried his step towards the floor below, where his lord awaited him.{nl}{np} His lord was a man who had earned the honorable title of Great King after unifying the lands of the Kingdom. His name was Zachariel, but it had been years since anyone had called him by that monicker.{nl}{np} Of course, no one would ever doubt that even a king has a proper name, just as no one would ever dare to call one by that name.{nl}{np} To Kamof, who had known Zachariel from the times when he was only a landlord, the name now sounded unfamiliar.{nl}A couple more steps and the duke found himself in a room with the king and a few of his loyal subjects. Noticing him, King Zachariel greeted the duke with a wide smile.{nl}{np} [It pleases me to know that the construction of the mausoleum is going as planned. Thank you for your efforts, Kamof.]{nl}The duke replied.{nl}[Your Majesty. The mausoleum remains unfinished. It's far too soon to send away the workers.]{nl}[I was under the impression that only this floor had been cleared.]{nl}{np} [There is still work to be done here as well.]{nl}[I don't believe the work that needs to be done from now on is something we want outsiders to know.]{nl}[But Your Majesty. All the writings at the plateau were also carved by simple workers at Your Majesty's command. This is no different.]{nl}{np} [The men who carved the stones may have committed no crime, but the fact remains that we erased their memories by force. We mustn't allow demons or anyone with evil intentions to covet our legacy. But I also do not wish to betray my own people in such ways ever again.]{nl}{np} Determined to convince the king, Duke Kamof looked around at the other men standing by Zachariel.{nl}{np} Senior vassal Nbetgeller had served the king longer than anyone in the room. Commander Jupert Killen was in charge of overseeing all military operations. And there was general Glkahn Donihue, the king's personal guard. None of them offered to help support Kamof's argument.{nl}{np}  Duke Denonn Sherivic, the highest aristocrat in the judicial field, was the first to speak.{nl}[I say, if His Majesty is willing to take a hammer and chisel in his own hands, who are we to refuse? I understand it is your duty to ensure the efficiency of this construction, but remember, there are much more important things to consider now.]{nl}Kamof was quick to reply.{nl}[Did I ever refuse to work for His Majesty? What I am saying is that those who have been tasked with governing the nation ought to do just that. Forgoing that work for a stonemasonry project seems awfully out of place.]{nl}{np} Sherivic did not back down.{nl}[It's all been explained by His Majesty. We may not know every detail about why this mausoleum was built, but certainly you know it isn't a mere whim of His Majesty's.{nl}{np} You know this structure is a provision for a catastrophe that will threaten our Kingdom and humanity itself. If not us, who do you suggest handles such an important task?]{nl}{np} It was then that Glkahn Donihue, the man responsible for the king's personal protection, first intervened.{nl}{np} [You are both correct. Your Majesty. The Royal Knights can complete this task under the command of our major general, if Your Majesty allows. The Royal Guard will not disclose any information concerning the mausoleum. As it happens, the men that arrived today with our major general are some of our most reliable.]{nl}{np} The reply came from senior vassal Nbetgeller, who until then had remained silent.{nl}[I understand His Majesty's intentions to protect the secret of the mausoleum. However, the men in this room are our court's highest representatives. I see no reason to mistrust them.{nl}{np} We must find a way to complete the task at hand without burdening the workers, nor ourselves.]{nl}[Is that possible, I ask?]{nl}At Zachariel's question, Nbetgeller explained,{nl}{np} [In my opinion, even if we are to complete the task through our own efforts, it's only right that we continue performing at least some of our governing duties. That is why...]{nl}[Yes?], Zachariel urged him.{nl}{np} [First, Your Majesty must allow us to use magic. Second, for the stone carvings, in lieu of hammers and chisels, we can make use of acids and chemicals to erode the stones.]{nl}[Magic and chemicals, you say. Isn't that dangerous?]{nl}{np} The old vassal knew what Zachariel meant with his short question, and he did not hesitate to answer.{nl}[All we need to do is handle the chemicals carefully. As for the magic, I don't believe it will affect the mausoleum's visitors in the future.{nl}{np} Your Majesty worries that our magic could someday be traced by a skilled wizard, leading them to the mausoleum and exposing our legacy to the world before the time is right. I understand that.{nl}{np} But Your Majesty, in time, skin that is burned with natural fire scars no different from skin that is burned with magic.{nl}{np} Any methods we use to carve our writings and symbols onto these stones will be simply that: methods. Your Majesty need not worry about them.]{nl}King Zachariel, seemingly convinced by the vassal's words, said, [Hm, is it feasible?]{nl}{np} [We can use General Donihue's soldiers to carry out the task and continue to focus on our original duties. The work at the plateau is complete. According to Duke Kamof's report, the mausoleum now requires only the final details. I would say the task is perfectly feasible.]{nl}[Very well. That is what we shall do.]{nl}{np} [Thank you, Your Majesty. But, if Your Majesty allows, I would like to pose a question.]{nl}[What is it?]{nl}[As far as I could tell, this mausoleum was built not for Your Majesty's eternal sleep, but for someone who is meant to visit it in the future.{nl}{np} Every inner working constitutes a test to that person's skill and intelligence, not to mention the safety provisions keeping the mausoleum from being approached by enemies and thieves. And yet, the work Your Majesty has entrusted upon us now seems to contradict that purpose entirely.]{nl}{np} [You are right to assume what this mausoleum is for. However, my purpose isn't simply to test those who may come for the goddess' Revelation.{nl}{np} You see, I wish to leave a gift for the visitor who completes the trials of this mausoleum. The path awaiting the one who finally enters these chambers will be unimaginably strenuous. My purpose is to leave for them a token of my appreciation, as well as a valuable message.{nl}{np} Who knows? To them it may be nothing but the preachings of a man who is long dead, but that is my wish.]{nl}Hearing this, Nbetgeller smiled as he prepared to address the king again.{nl}{np} [Your Majesty's knowledge is that of our founding monarchs. Your Majesty's teachings will not be in vain. In fact, may I suggest that this chamber be named after that?]{nl}{np} [Something like 'Hall of Knowledge', perhaps? I must say, it sounds rather awkward but it isn't so bad.]{nl}Nbetgeller added, [One cannot tell how much time will pass before the destined visitor finds their way to Your Majesty's blessed mausoleum.{nl}{np} I believe it is only right to pass onto our visitor as much knowledge as Your Majesty is willing to, regardless of the value that knowledge may hold in the future.]{nl}{np} [That is what I intend to do. I shall document everything that is allowed to me about deities and demons, the foundation and history of our Kingdom, and the will of the goddesses in the planning and construction of this mausoleum.{nl}{np} I wish, if it is possible, that all of this is left here in this Royal Mausoleum. And if there is still space, I wish to leave my own memoir.]{nl}{np} The King said these words with an air of confidence. His vassals bowed their heads in reverence not simply because he sat in a seat of power, but because he represented a piece of the Goddess' divine providence.{nl}{np} Note: After discussing the matter with Cyrenia Odell, it appears that the record above about the Royal Mausoleum does not properly represent the legacy of the King.{nl}Due to this, I have done additional research and have concluded the following possiblities:{nl}{np} First, there is no truth behind these documents.{nl}I, through basic reasoning, have ruled out this possibility.{nl}Two, the Royal Mausoleum was opened and through certain means the legacy of King Zachariel has been corrupted or damaged.{nl}{np} And finally, three, the most likely possibility is that the real legacy of King Zachariel resides in the Great Woodlands in the mysterious mausoleum.{nl}Which means, for some particular reason, the King did not leave his legacy in his own mausoleum while at the same time requesting that his predecessors keep the second one a secret.{nl}{np} If this is true, then it is now difficult for us now to know if the legacy matches with their respective kings in their appropriate tombs.{nl} {np} As the location of the mausoleum in Great Woodlands has not been confirmed, it is still difficult to conclude as to why the King and those who came after him, made such a decision.{nl}{np} - Year 1096 of the Kingdom,{nl}First Year of Consul Kaonilla{nl}Sage Master Lufas Kehel",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

But this will result in fewer followers.{nl}She and the few that do follow her act as mercenaries and can be employed for a price, yet this is not their main focus.{nl}Because of her unique character and the interesting nature of her followers, she may continue to reject the Highlander Master's calls for a partnership.{nl}{np} 3. Pyromancer Master Abreh Melinn{nl}Abreh Melinn is an atypical Wizard who has been able to find an effective fusion between faith in the goddesses and magic research.{nl}{np} Her exceptional achievement in magic is thanks to a blessing from Goddess Gabija, which also allowed her to reach previously unknown heights in fire magic.{nl}In her glory days, it is said that even Agailla Flurry's fire magic was no match for Abreh Melinn's burning flame.{nl}{np} 4.

Either way, they are headed towards death.]{nl}Ragana added.{nl}{np} [There is a chance that the very strongest of them will neither die nor live and instead be completely frozen.]{nl}Medeina added her own guesswork.{nl}{np} Goddess Austeja let out a sigh and spoke.{nl}[Whatever the case may be they are also living things. Yes, they are a danger to our world, but if it was at all possible simply locking them up would have been better...{nl}{np} The Creator has told us to protect this world and the humans, but did not instruct us on how to do so. It was Giltine who decided to take such measures and they are ones that I cannot agree with.]{nl}{np} [Well, consider what was said before. Those monsters may go into hibernation. That's almost the same as shackling them. We can just catch the ones that escape and, if you really want, you don't have to kill them. If you wish to seal them up I won't stand in your way.{nl}{np} But I don't know if you have the power to do so by yourself, Austeja. If you were planning to wait here, then you can also consider helping us get rid of the beasts that are coming this way.]{nl}Baubas said.{np} It was then that Goddess Medeina spoke.{nl}[We're lucky that they have not accidentally left their world to roam here. And the ones that will come will be few. Because of this only five or so of us need to wait for those who escape...]{np} Goddess Zemyna replied to her sister.{nl}[That is correct for now, but if the energy of the Divine Tree continues to spread this world will become fit for those beasts and even more will arrive. Making this task harder.{nl}{np} Right now it does not matter as the humans will be protected. But still, more of those beasts will encroach upon this world to cause problems. Now is the best time to protect them from such beasts.{nl}{np} The energy of the Creator's Divine Tree is spreading slowly but it is as yet not a barren world.]{nl}Baubas for an indiscernible reason chuckled and said.{nl}[There are those of you who think well.]{nl}{np} Austeja seemed to show a bit of resentment towards this.{nl}[We always think the correct way. You and your friends follow the Creator's wishes and yet think you are acting on your own. This is especially true of Giltine.]{nl}{np} As though provoked, Ragana spoke next.{nl}[Well then, has Ausrine even once accomplished bringing you as all together as a team?]{nl}[There was never a time where it was necessary. As we concentrate on our own work we are able to complete the Creator's wishes.]{nl}{np} [So like that you are all doing your work well, even Laima? When she receives prophecies and controls fortunes, what is she doing? Is there nothing to fix? Or do you know and would rather not share it with us? Is that it?]{nl}{np} [Is there a sister who does not know of the persecution Laima faces from knowing the future? You know of this too, don't you, Ragana? Receiving these powers from the Creator is not something that we can play with. Furthermore, it is a power that one cannot use for one's own ambition.]{nl}{np} [So you're saying that Giltine wants the power handed down from the Creator for herself?]{nl}[That is not what I'm saying. I'm saying that Giltine is using it as justification for her to have her way and overreacting by destroying a whole dimension...]{nl}At this, Ragana interrupted Austeja.{nl}{np} [You may argue the pros and cons of Giltine but since the eternal sleep of the Creator, the truth is, we have not seen a greater leader than Giltine.{nl}{np} This is a task that Ausrine has also supported. To round up and kill those beasts so that the world and the humans you love have a future. It's clear that these circumstances are unavoidable despite it not being to your or Ausrine's liking.{nl}{np} But it is here that Baubas and I have come to provide help, however, make it known that we do so not for the humans.]{nl}{np} At Ragana's words Austeja and she made eye contact. There was nothing logical that Austeja could say in retort and rather than denouncing Giltine she decided to avoid further conflict by averting her eyes.{nl}{np} And that was when Medeina spoke.{nl}[We are responsible. Although we have our differences, we cannot continue to quarrel. Are we not here for the sake of this world? And more importantly, the very beasts we have been waiting for will soon make an appearance.]{nl}{np} In that moment, in the air, black dots appeared.{nl}These beasts, bearing wings, were falling out of the sky.{nl}As an effect of their unintentional and haphazard dimensional travel, they were unable to use their wings despite their efforts.{nl}{np} There were a few who were able to unfurl their wings, yet rather than fly they tried to their best to glide themselves into a soft landing.{nl}{np} Goddess Medeina spoke the words,{nl}[They cannot be left alone,]{nl} and reaching out her hand she summoned countless arrows of light to swarm upwards and into the blue sky.{nl}{np} As the first of the beasts to adapt had yet to collect themselves, the arrows hit their mark perfectly. If they had not, the beasts would have landed where the five deities were waiting. Instead, they were thrown off their mark and fell elsewhere nearby.{nl}{np} Baubas saw this and spoke to Goddess Zemyna.{nl}[When they hit the ground use that earth power of yours to trap them. It'll be annoying if they fly off.]{nl}She replied.{nl}[That's fine, but I'll need some time to properly bind them.{nl}{np} Ragana responded.{nl}[Is that necessary? If we kill them all, it'll be fine. That's all the time we will need.]{nl}But Baubas had other thoughts.{nl}{np} [It will be pointless if they escape. Let us go with the original plan. Ensure that not one of them flies free. Austeja can stay out of the fight and instead protect Zemyna until she completes the ceremony. That way you two won't have to get your hands dirty...]{nl}{np} When Baubas said this the two goddesses agreed to the task.{nl}In a matter of seconds, in the distant sky, more dots appeared that caught the god's eyes. It was more of the beasts.{nl}Later, in legends, these monsters would be known to humans as dragons.{nl}{np} Medeina once again sent a score of arrows into the air.{nl}The vast majority of these dragons who had come to this world to escape the onslaught from Giltine crashed to the ground. The impact killing many, while those who were still hanging on were in no better condition.{nl}{np} Regardless, there were some who did not die from the impact and were able to avoid Medeina's attack.{nl}However, despite their efforts to glide to safety, these remaining dragons were unable to control their drift and crashed into the ground.{nl}{np} As a result, there was not one dragon who reached the ground unscathed.{nl}Baubas looked about him and said.{nl}[If I had known that these would be the only ones to arrive, I could have handled this on my own.]{nl}{np} To everyone's surprise, it was not the goddesses who responded, but Ragana.{nl}[If you were alone, more of them would have survived and Zemyna too would not be here to tie them up.]{nl}[Everyone lent a hand, you know.]{nl}[It's just there were not as many here as Laima foresaw...]{nl}{np} [Meaning you do not trust in her predictions...]{nl}Having already expressed those feelings to Ragana privately, Baubas turned his attention back to the battlefield,{nl} where there still remained a dragon on the brink of death.{nl}[Well look at that. Leave him to me. You all can clean up the rest.]{nl}{np} Without waiting for a response, he set out to fight the beast.{nl}Medeina let out a sigh, and Ragana watched briefly as Baubas walked away, before they both set about on their own task of checking for survivors.{nl}It was work that involved ensuring that the dead dragons really were dead.{nl}{np} As Baubas approached his target, he began to hear the dragon.{nl}It was not through voice, but it was possible for them to communicate.{nl}[You with the wicked smell, who are you? You devils have destroyed our home forcing us to come here. What possible reason could you have to commit such a crime?]{nl} {np} Baubas replied with a sneer as an answer to the question.{nl}However, this proved ineffective as the dragon had no knowledge of the demon gods and goddesses of this world and thus disregarded the expression.{nl}{np} However, as their minds were in tune with each other Baubas was able to convey the meaning behind the gesture.{nl}[You have a lot of questions. But it will be difficult to tell you my name in your language. I believe the same will hold true for you as well.{nl}{np} Regardless, if I am to answer you, although I do not know how it will be received, my name is Baubas. Your name from ancient times would be Boruta in our language.{nl}{np} And as a sign of kindness, to answer your other question, it is because your kind has wandered that extinction became necessary. I don't know about Austeja, but it means nothing to me. I mean that I do not care about justifying myself to such creatures.{nl}{np} To think of you as something that has intelligence and should be respected, it is quite annoying. I see you as something I can release my anger upon. As I cannot fight my fellow gods and humans are much too weak.]{nl}{np} [Huh? Our kind? Humans? What do you mean?]{nl}[At that's right. You had no interest in knowing about this world or what type of beings live here, but suddenly you would appear and devour what was here, am I not right? Because of that sort of stupid attitude, it's obvious as to why you are where you are today.{nl}{np} If there weren't so many of you I would have finished you all off myself, but Giltine being both wiser and stronger has more efficiently rounded you up as so. And seeing how it turned out, even Austeja would agree.]{nl} {np} [Cease! No matter what you say it is because of you that our kind has been slaughtered. This world's concerns mean nothing to us. To avoid the predictor you have started your destiny with this game.]{nl}[That is true, but you do not know the subject of the matter.]{nl}{np} With that said, Baubas went into action.{nl}Baubas launched an attack on Boruta's back.{nl}Boruta believed he could stop the blow but it proved futile.{nl}It was because his speed was quicker and his attacks sharper than those of dragons.{nl}{np} It was the first time in Boruta's life to feel such pain. He was just barely able to block the second attack with his claw.{nl}At least, so he thought.{nl}He did in fact block the blow but as a consequence his claw fractured.{nl}{np} His claw, unlike its back, would be able to heal in a matter of moments, but Baubas used this moment of weakness to attack at Boruta's back again.{nl}With the claw destroyed, Baubas could have easily attacked another location, such as the wings, but instead decided to aim for the torso, clearly not giving the battle his all.{nl}{np} [At this rate my full strength, let alone a weapon, will not be necessary...]{nl}It was here that Boruta came to realize the embarrassing truth. In a one-to-one fight against Baubas, he would be unable to win.{nl}{np} Baubas had also mentioned in passing that if there were not so many and the fight was fair, there would be a chance he would win.{nl}It was exactly because of this strength and number that they have lived so peacefully in their own world for so many years.{nl}{np} Even after discovering this other world, these beasts were so involved in themselves that they did not concern themselves with the beings this world calls gods.{nl}But the price of this ignorance was costly.{nl}They were massacred and before Boruta stood his own death.{nl}{np} Boruta unfurled his right wing, successfully whipping Baubas away. As Baubas came in for another attack, Boruta was able to send him flying again.{nl}Now that the strength in his wings had returned, he planned to rise.{nl}Yet his intention was not to flee but to attack from a better position.{nl}{np} But in the next moment, the realization came to him. He was unable to take flight.{nl}Although Boruta was unable to identify Baubas' expression, Baubas was overcome with satisfaction watching Boruta's moment of failure.{nl}This time around, he sprung towards the dragon, directing a blow to his head.{nl} {np} The pain of such blows to his torso and head where unknown to Boruta.{nl}It was because an attack had never drilled through his leather hide.{nl}Of course, this does not mean that in their world, when fights broke out there was an absence of dragons who suffered such damaging blows.{nl}{np} There were those who yowled after facing such an attack, while there were others with worse damages who kept their mouths firmly shut.{nl}As Boruta was always on the winning end, this level of pain was one he had yet to experience.{nl}But now in this strange world from a strange being he was being taught how much his body could endure and the distressing truth that he wasn't as strong as he thought.{nl}{np} Seen another way, one could believe that the dragon was simply unlucky.{nl}No matter the situation, he could not win.{nl}As such he must run.{nl}As he could not fly, his only means of escape was to carry his wounded body on foot.{nl}{np} Yet, following behind the dragon was a carefree and smiling Baubas.{nl}Although Boruta was running, he was still easily overcome by the Demon God Baubas' casual pace.{nl}Because of his wounds and the superior power of Baubas, Boruta was no longer in a situation where he could escape.{nl}{np} At that moment, without a sound, Austeja appeared at Baubas' side.{nl}Even though he had only heard the sound of wings, Baubas was aware of Her arrival.{nl}As he turned his head towards Her, She spoke.{nl}{np} [Let him be.]{nl}[Haha sorry but you cannot just ask to have things your way. Why? Why should I let him go?]{nl}[He might be the last of the dragons...]{nl}{np} [That may be true but, there may still be survivors in their own world as well. Not just here, but how are we to know there aren't survivors in the other places.]{nl}[Yes but, at least here there are none.]{nl}[So we save him and then he'll kill the humans? That beast may not know their strength, but without effort he could easily devour them all.]{nl}{np} [We can hide him somewhere underground. That way, Zemyna, who reigns over the earth, will be aware of his location. We just have to seal him so he doesn't escape. If we seal him deep within the earth, without the strength of Zemyna nor the Creator, no one will be able to free it. Even for Ausrine and Giltine it will be difficult.]{nl}{np} [This type of attitude suits you. Fine. If that's what you want, let's do it. But I'm curious about two things.]{nl}[And that would be?]{nl}[No, three things. When will I get to hear your begging again? When will I get to see you fight? And when will Boruta again be released? These three things I'm curious about.]{nl}{np} [All three are impossible.]{nl}Austeja's expression hardened in response.{nl}[Huh, don't joke too much. You never know when the time will come again when you will need another favor from me. Or when we too will have to fight. Whether the Creator awakens or that power engulfs the world again.]{nl}{np} [If you want payment for saving it...]{nl}[And I want that now. I enjoy killing but I hate the cleanup. Yet someone needs to deal with these dragon carcasses. I see this duty fit for you to thank me for all that I've done.]{nl} Like this, Baubas spoke and before Austeja could respond, he departed.{nl}{np} But it wasn't the leftover work that Baubas had pushed upon Her that stayed with Her. It was the gloomy foreboding thought that {nl}'whatever occurs, Laima knows all.'{nl}Her eyes fell upon the body of the dragon before Her and She began Her work.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

Right-click to read. ,icon_item_collection_00basic,,,,,,#N/A,1," * Herrmun-Madale{nl}River Crossing Incident Vol. 1{nl}{np} Fifty one days had passed since the death of King Zachariel.{nl}He had died at the age of 51 and it was his son, Zeromel, who received the title of Lord. He now sat on the throne with his head in his hands.{nl}Over twenty lords and the royal family congregated together at the palace to commiserate the passing. They were well aware of the dilemma the king was facing, but since no one wanted to be the first to bring up the topic, they waited in silence.{nl}{np} It was Licsion, brother to the King, who finally spoke.{nl}[There is nothing more to say. We will command them to cease on the King's orders. If they do not listen, we may then use military force. Whoever you send, shall not be defeated. On your command, any one of us will go.]{nl}{np} [But if this suggestion is followed, the peace we have had for 40 years will be broken. And in history, our king would be recorded as the one who was inaugurated and then went to war. He would be known as the king who was unable to keep the peace his ancestors had restored.]{nl}{np} These words came from the next in line to the throne, the crown prince. Another member of the royal family spoke next.{nl}[Let us use a royal order to evict them. If needed we can extend their territories. Rather than punishing them for insubordination, pursuing disciplinary action would be more justifiable.]{nl}{np} Another member spoke.{nl}[If we command them to cease their fighting and they do not listen, will they then listen to us as we command them to change their dominion? There is a high possibility that they will ignore us and we will have no choice but to mobilize the troops.{nl}{np} The King will have no choice but to see this as a mutiny. This will also destroy the peace our previous kings have fought for since the founding of this Kingdom. This too will result in a revolt.]{nl}{np} The first member to speak, spoke again.{nl}[Who here does not know this? In any case, is there no better reason than this to use the army? And if a war begins, their lack of military strategy will be their downfall.{nl}{np} Their troops may be greater, but they will not have the help of the wizards and the goddesses' priests. Those families may have confidence in their fighting abilities but they will ultimately be at a disadvantage.]{nl}Although he spoke as such, his confidence did not match the tone of his words.{nl}{np} The issue facing the nobles and the royal families was as follows.{nl}The Herrmun Family and the Madale family were currently the two strongest nobilities in the Kingdom.{nl}And as luck would have it, they shared neighboring territories.{np} Just like typical neighbors, they could not coexist in peace and, although during the 40-year reign of King Zachariel the two families did not publicly show their displeasure, it was inevitable that their hostility would erupt into conflict.{nl} {np} As the ruling power of the Kingdom was passing hands for the second time, the pressure placed upon the noble families was lessened, thus giving the two ambitious families an opportunity they could not overlook.{nl}{np} It was not in defiance of the Kingdom, but thinking that there would be no other opportunity before them, they took action. Thus believing that if a result could be determined, then the royal family would have no choice to but accept.{nl}{np} And as both families were headed by those who felt confident in their military prowess, they believed that this was the only way forward.{nl}{np} On one hand, in the early days ascension disputes were settled with the Kingdom's military, but if the new King's ascension to power was indeed disputed the moment the previous King had passed away, this displeasure would have been known.{nl}There was not one person who wanted to go against the royal family nor who sided with the feuding nobles.{nl}{np} As such, they would not receive help from the priests and the wizards thus, objectively, it would result in a win for the throne. However, the two families' boasting of military prowess is not an overstatement.{nl}{np} In any case, one side would win and one would lose. If the king's army was to appear,  the two noble families would deal with these soldiers first. If this was the case and they advanced even one step the situation could become uncontrollable.{nl}{np} The royal family's authority to rule would be questioned as the army would be criticized for its weakness. If news spread to the nobles who swear allegiance to the throne the foundation of the Kingdom would be shaken.{nl}{np} However, thanks to the goddesses the unified Kingdom would remain and the priests, through the goddesses, would keep the Kingdom safe. But the royal presence would be but a memory as nobles from all regions chose to do as they like. And the royal name would be ignored as the country falls into chaos.{nl}{np} There were no instances in history that could be referenced, but King Zeromel and those who were gathered here knew that the foundation of the Kingdom was not on the monarch but on a change lead forth by the second monarch.{nl}Again, a silence lingered until finally, Duke Greeo, the eldest of the nobles who gathered here, spoke.{nl}{np} [From what I know, currently the Royal Army has 24,000 troops. And when the previous King had checked, the total number of troops that could be mobilized in the case of an emergency was estimated at 170,000. If you choose to limit the number of guards in each city, you will be able to mobilize more.{nl}{np} If the Duke of Herrmun mobilizes his troops, they will be about 12,000 strong. Duke Madale would be 8,000. Therefore, together about 20,000 troops. If both sides slander their fortunes and hire the maximum amount of mercenaries while also mobilizing another nobles' of whom they are close with, the total could be doubled to 40,000.]{nl}[Why are you suddenly doing such calculations?]{nl} {np} [If we use 24,000 troops from the king's army against these 40,000 troops we will be using military force, but if we only send 4,000 it would not appear as such. This will not be enough to stop a war or to take disciplinary action. But, it is more than enough to be used as escorts for a representative of the royal family.]{nl}{np} A silence followed after Greeo's words and King Zeromel was the first to break it.{nl}[If the rank of this representative is high enough that would be an acceptable amount of troops. For example, if it was a king, correct?] His brother, Licsion, shared a thought.{nl}{np} [But we are not saying that Your Majesty should be the one to go. But if these troops did not escort a king, then it would be excessive.]{nl}The first to speak of such an idea, Duke Greeo, spoke again.{nl}{np} [This is why the crown prince must be the one to go. With this we can properly assess the situation while also showing that we take such issues seriously and present a dignified appearance.]{nl}Licsion heard this and was quick to reply.{nl}{np} [This would be a good chance to bestow onto the crown prince His Majesty's title. He would then be Zeromel II.{nl}Like this, we can take care of things under the king's title.{nl}{np} By the authority of the king, he will receive this title and complete the work set before him.{nl}This will also secure the next line of succession.]{nl}{np} Another member of the family spoke.{nl}[Sending the crown prince with an imperial authority will carry more weight. Like this, he can address the situation directly and deal with whatever problems that may occur. I see no problem with this.{nl}{np} However, I'm curious as to how Duke Greeo came to the conclusion of 4,000 troops. if your decision is not to appear strong, then why not 3,000 or why not more, such as 5,000? My intention is not to shine doubt on this, but rather for us to collectively discern the correct number of troops that we need to send.]{nl}{np} And this, Duke Greeo replied.{nl}[Because if necessary, we may need to use military force. 4,000 may not be able to repress the opposition, but they will easily be able to join together with other forces if necessary.{nl}{np} I previously calculated that there would be 40,000 troops. But in truth, they may be less than that. If we take into account that our opponent cannot use priests or wizards, then in truth the number of troops could be two times less.]{nl}{np} Now the question of where to get such troops could not be avoided.{nl}But before it was raised, the Duke answered.{nl}{np} [We will request troops from the Kingdom's noble families. I, of course, will be the first to gather my troops. Although we cannot predict how many will answer the call, I believe we can gather 40,000.{nl}{np} 4,000 is one-tenth of 40,000, which is a decent number to go with the crown prince. And 40,000 will match the number of both sides' men. We will be able to defeat them with this amount and we can use the priests and wizards if the situation calls for it.{nl}{np} The crown prince will try to persuade both sides and if that fails we can use military force. If it comes to this, it will not only be the royal family in attendance but all of the Kingdom's noble families as well. It will become a situation that justifies dispatching the soldiers.]{nl}{np} King Zeromel opened his mouth to speak again.{nl}[Not much time has passed since my ascension to the throne and already my title has been changed from Zeromel to Zeromel I. This is good. If none oppose this decision, it will be accepted.{nl}{np} Operational plans and military decisions will be headed by the crown prince, while reports will be made to me.]{nl}There was no one in the palace who opposed the decision and for the time being this was their response to the situation.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0
690095,TAOKAKA_BOOK,Story of Taokaka's adventure during the era of King Melkhiel. Right-click to read. ,icon_item_collection_00basic,,,,,,#N/A,1," Below is a popular lore scholars believe was written during the reign of King Melkhiel.{nl}Various records of the adventures of Taokaka exist, but it is safe to believe the story documented here is closest to the original.{nl}{np} - Sage Master Lufas Kehel{nl}{np} * The Adventures of Taokaka{nl}{np} One day, on a secluded path, Taokaka came across a demon.{nl}Since he was a polite boy regardless of the situation he decided to address the demon himself.{nl}This was also not the first time for Taokaka to come across such danger and as such he was already experienced in such things.{nl}{np} [Hello, what are you doing?]{nl}[I'm spinning the wheel of destiny.]{nl}The demon answered curtly.{nl}There was, in fact, a spinning wheel before the demon.{nl}{np} [A wheel? And why are you spinning it?]{nl}[This is the wheel of destiny. By spinning the wheel one can take away what another has and give to them what they did not. The fruits of these trades are within the wheel. Spinning the wheel again will randomly give one to the owner.]{nl}{np} [That sounds nice.]{nl}[Maybe not. The wheel will return to the target something they hold dear, something they have forgotten, but what it will give to the owner cannot be surmised.{nl}{np} And if you're the owner of the wheel, you must spin it seven times. Whatever escapes on the seventh spin, must be accepted.]{nl}[Where are you at now?]{nl}[Six.]{nl}{np} [Then will you spin it again?]{nl}[Only if you agree to accept it.]{nl}[And if I don't?]{nl}[Then I will kill you.]{nl}[Well, it seems I have no choice.]{nl}{np} [Yes. I have killed those before you who rejected me. If you fear death, then don't delay and accept this magic wheel. Accept it and I will leave with whatever gift the wheel grants me.{nl}{np} All this time I have carefully chosen who to spin the wheel for and now only good remains within it. Now if I spin the wheel, it will take something cherished from you, and give something for you and something for me. This also means that whatever you receive won't be bad.{nl}{np} Of course, if this wasn't the seventh rotation, then there is no need for two gifts to appear. It always takes one and gives one.]{nl}[Alright. Well spin the wheel, then give it to me.]{nl}The demon, with a mixed sense of freedom and accomplishment, spun the spinning wheel one last time.{nl}{np} Both the demon and Taokaka knew that the wheel took something from Taokaka, but what it was they did not know.{nl}The demon saw this and spoke.{nl}{np} [It must be something abstract like a feeling. That's why it can't be seen. If it was something like intelligence or courage, you would suddenly become stupid or filled with fear. Since that's not the case, at the moment, whatever it is can't be known.]{nl}{np} As the demon said that, something from the wheel entered him.{nl}It could not be seen, but what it was could easily be known.{nl}The demon's appearance changed into something more sinister.{nl}Whoever saw could tell that the demon had obtained additional strength.{nl}{np} He gave a sinister, demonic smile and spoke.{nl}[I have obtained unbelievable strength. With this, in the demon realm I can win the rank of Demon Lord. Endless vitality would have been more beneficial in surviving the many battles but I'm pleased with this improvement. {np} Regardless, things have turned out well. Boy, I'm leaving. Before you spin the wheel on me. Hahahaha!]{nl}With those words, the demon disappeared without a trace.{nl}{np} Taokaka, without a stir, simply picked up the wheel and said, [Well then wait, we will meet again...]{nl}And he continued walking.{nl}{np} As he walked with the wheel in hand, he was pulled towards the sound of music in the distance and followed it to an open field in the forest where a group of people was holding a masquerade.{nl}Taokaka spun the wheel and the music was absorbed.{nl}{np} It was because, here, music was the most precious commodity.{nl}In return, the wheel gave those at the masquerade the virtue of honesty. In that moment, they ripped off their masks and revealed to each other their true selves.{nl}{np} Taokaka continued on his journey once again.{nl}On the path before him was a toy knife.{nl}It was shaped like a sword, but it was a toy just bigger than the size of one's palm.{nl}Here, Taokaka spun the wheel.{nl}From the toy knife came its most precious possession, fun.{nl}{np} And because what the toy knife was missing was an owner, the wheel gave it one. Its new owner became Taokaka.{nl}{np} Now carrying both the wheel and the toy knife, Taokaka continued walking and met a person apathetically working on the soil.{nl}In front of this person, Taokaka spun the wheel. {np} From the wheel came the fun that was taken from the toy knife. With this, the bored worker suddenly realized the insurmountable excitement he could have from his work.{nl}And in return, the wheel took what was most important to him, one day's wage.{nl}{np} As though struck by a dream, the worker understood that he would miss one day's wage, but since tomorrow too he could enjoy his work and be paid, all was well.{nl}{np} And although he was not there and did not know the proceedings of where and how to deliver this wage, the worker's employer went about doing so without a second thought.{nl}{np} As Taokaka continued on his way, he passed many people and places, but if the need to spin the wheel did not come, he moved on.{nl}With that in mind, when he came across a discarded wine bottle, he spun the wheel.{nl}{np} The feelings of intoxication and drunkenness entered the wheel.{nl}And in return, it gave music.{nl}Now if one had the wine, one would not get drunk but rather would hear the sounds of music. And Taokaka continued on.{nl}{np} Time passed before Taokaka stopped before the corpse of a fallen knight.{nl}It was clear that the knight had fought to his death.{nl}Nearby was what appeared to be his sword and the signs of a struggle.{nl}{np} Taokaka spun the spinning wheel before the corpse.{nl}The powerful death of the fallen knight entered the wheel.{nl}And the wheel gave the corpse what the demon had spoken of before he had left, endless vitality.{nl}{np} When the fallen knight received the gift, he was revived.{nl}He spoke to Taokaka and gave him his thanks.{nl}From the knight, Taokaka learned that the killer was the demon from whom he had received the wheel.{nl}{np} And from the knight he also learned that the demon had traveled to various other places, leaving a path of destruction in his wake as he searched to obtain only the best.{nl}He learned that the knight had died in pursuit of this vile demon.{nl}{np} The knight said he would pursue the demon again, and Taokaka said he too was in pursuit.{nl}This is because Taokaka wanted to take back what the wheel had taken from him.{nl}{np} To get back what was taken someone must be the target of the spin and Taokaka believed his target must be the demon.{nl}Therefore, Taokaka and the knight set off together to find him.{nl}Since the seventh spin of the wheel must be saved for the demon, Taokaka resolved to spin the wheel once more.{nl}{np} After careful deliberation, Taokaka selected the toy knife and spun the wheel again.{nl}The wheel gave to the toy the death that was taken from the knight's corpse.{nl}{np} But what it took was its ownership. The knife was no longer Taokaka's nor was it anyone else's.{nl}Put other way, one could say the rights of ownership were taken from the toy and now belonged to the wheel.{nl}{np} Although the wheel had taken death from the knight's corpse, it was not the only thing that it gave the toy knife as now death itself was unclear and the knife's very concept of ownership was altered.{nl}{np} Regardless, now whomever touched the toy had nothing before them but their demise.{nl}As without an owner, it would become an uncontrollable knife of death.{nl}But as luck would have it, the revived knight carried within him endless vitality and as such was unable to be killed by the death pervading the knife.{nl}{np} And as such, the knight became its sole owner.{nl}With the knife under his control, the two set off again on their journey in pursuit of the demon.{nl}And before long, they came across the demon who had given Taokaka the wheel. The demon spoke first.{nl}{np} [This is quite unusual. To meet you again and even more so, to be greeted by this knight that I have already killed. How are you alive?]{nl}Taokaka replied.{nl}[That's not important.]{nl}[Then what is? Human boy.]{nl}{np} The demon asked and Taokaka answered.{nl}[Returning to me what had left when you had spun the wheel. In other words, I want what was cut from me. Good or bad it was mine.]{nl}{np} This sparked the demon's curiosity and he asked,{nl}[Alright, then what was it that the wheel cut?]{nl}[As my grandmother once told me, since the day I was born I received a blessing from the goddess. A blessing of luck tied to misfortune, she said.]{nl}{np} [Luck tied to misfortune?]{nl}[Yes. The misfortune is the reason why I meet demons like you or other dangers, but because of the luck I always win. But this time, it has been cut and a part of that blessing has entered the wheel.]{nl}{np} As soon as he heard this, the knight spoke.{nl}[Whatever the case, it seems what has entered the wheel must be luck. And since the bad luck has nowhere to go, it attached itself to someone else.]{nl}{np} Taokaka nodded and replied.{nl}[It seems that way. This is why you have met me again.]{nl}As he said these words, he spun the spinning wheel.{nl}By then it was already too late for the demon to escape and whatever came out from the wheel was what he would have to accept.{nl}{np} The wheel spun, but the demon who understood the nature behind the wheel believed he still had a chance.{nl}He would gather his strength, attack Taokaka and the knight and steal the wheel again.{nl}Even if the wheel took what strength it had given, he would still have his original power which would be enough to finish the task, he thought.{nl}{np} However, the wheel did not take away from the demon the strength it had given.{nl}Instead, it took from him the misfortune that had caused him to meet Taokaka again.{nl}{np} This was good for the demon until the wheel rewarded him with the intoxication and drunkenness that it had taken from the wine bottle.{nl} The demon did not lose himself in his drunken state, but he had no choice but to be overcome by the feeling.{nl}{np} As a result, he was unable to speak and stumbled along until he fell to the ground.{nl}At this point, Taokaka felt no further need to spin the wheel.{nl}This is because the luck from the goddess' blessing had been released and rejoined with the misfortune that had left the demon, before finally being returned to Taokaka.{nl}{np} The fallen demon, who knew his only choice now was to use the wheel, fumbled in a drunken stupor towards Taokaka.{nl}Taokaka gently rested the wheel on the ground and stepped back. The demon, with a smile of satisfaction that only a drunkard could make, picked up the wheel.{nl}{np} The same smile plastered on his face, he spun the wheel.{nl}The wheel took from the demon his intoxication and rewarded him with the power of ownership.{nl}{np} Like that, the demon became the everlasting owner of the wheel and become unable to pass on the wheel to anyone or anything in existence.{nl}Moreover, the demon knew that the wheel had taken his intoxication but he had yet to realize what it had given him.{nl}{np} As the demon sat there puzzled, still considering the situation, the knight stepped forward and touched the demon with the tip of the toy's blade.{nl}As the demon's thoughts were preoccupied with other matters, he did not think twice to avoid the attack, believing the weapon to be a mere toy.{nl}{np} But in this knife was death and it killed the demon where he sat.{nl}And with his death also meant the death of the owner of the spinning wheel.{nl} {np} Although they tried, the knight and Taokaka came to realize that they could no longer spin the wheel, let alone even pick it up.{nl}{np} In the end, the knight and Taokaka left.{nl}And not too long afterward, Goddess Laima appeared.{nl}As there was no one in possession of the spinning wheel, Goddess Laima was now able to retrieve it with ease.{nl}{np} And so, with the wheel of destiny returned to the goddess who rules one's fate, Goddess Laima disappeared.{nl}And it is here where the story of Taokaka, and his bottle of wine that does not intoxicate but plays music, and the knight, with the knife that can kill all, comes to an end.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

It's my own fault that I wasted my noble blood only to die like this. I only regret never having done anything for you.]{nl}{np} The girl shook her head.{nl}[Please don't say that. You have to get better.]{nl}[If only I had the fortune of your grandfather, your future would have been very different.]{nl}[I can take care of my future.]{nl}[I'm sorry.]{nl}{np} Her father repeated the words one more time when, as if all energy had left him, he closed his eyes and fell asleep.{nl}Chridela, having skipped already two meals in a row, succumbed to hunger and fatigue as she, too, went to sleep.{nl}When she woke up, her father had already left the world.{nl}{np} After the humble funeral, arranged with the help of the villagers, young Chridela could do nothing but cry in her empty house. Her tears had only just dried out when she heard someone knock on the door.{nl}{np} Chridela didn't answer, but the door wasn't locked, and they came in through the open door.{nl}There were two of them; one was the village elder, the other was a man she didn't recognize.{nl}{np} The man took one look at Chridela and sighed. He said to her,{nl}[I know your father met someone like me not long ago, and I know it won't be easy hearing what I have to say to you, but...]{nl}{np} Before he could continue, Chridela wiped her face to stare boldly at the man.{nl}[An Otero never avoids responsibility, for better or for worse. What is it that you came to tell me?]{nl}The man looked back with a hint of surprise on his face.{nl}{np} [You are brave for such a young girl. People used to say no one in the family was half as good as Manel Otero.]{nl}The man observed Chridela's expression, but the fact that he had just insulted her family didn't seem to bother her.{nl}{np} It wasn't that she didn't understand, she was only being cautious.{nl}The man was again surprised by her attitude.{nl}This time, he addressed her in a serious tone.{nl}{np} [Manel Otero, the founder of your family, was granted noble status under His Majesty, King Termanel, the 38th ruler of our Kingdom. By the third generation, all of your family's property, assets and valuables had been either sold or impounded.{nl}{np} Paintings by Sakkurrhe, the great artist of King Wardel's era, were let go at a price that doesn't nearly compare to their value. A most regretful decision, if I may say. Your father had nothing but the noble status of his name, and now he is no more.]{nl}{np} [You don't have to tell me what I already know. You should start by telling me who you are.]{nl}[Oh! Where are my manners? I am Kdit, from the Kedora Merchant Alliance. I can't really say it's nice to meet you at a time like this.{nl}{np} Alas, this is how we had to meet. I'm surprised you were already aware of all of that. But there's something you need to know.]{nl}{np} Chridela waited for the man to continue.{nl}[Your father may have been born to a noble family, but under our law, that privileged status does not last forever. The Otero family has never made significant contributions to the Kingdom. What's more, they wasted their reputation and wealth throughout the generations.{nl}{np} That is why your noble status has been revoked. Your family will no longer receive the benefits granted to the noble class, particularly in the fiscal sector. Perhaps fortunately, your family has no more wealth to benefit from. This house and all it contains will also become property of the Kedora Alliance.{nl}{np} Though it's a fortunate thing your father owes us and not another agency. We are not the type to strip a poor orphan girl of all her belongings to avoid losses. That said, we can't let you stay in this house anymore.{nl}{np} It's not just a matter of paying off your father's debt. You need to live with a legal guardian until you're an adult.]{nl}[A guardian?]{nl}{np} [Or you can be sent to an orphanage run by the clerics, though I do think a guardian is your best option. You'll be sent to your ruling lord, where you'll receive work and education. Most take the chance to learn a profession they can follow as adults. If you're talented enough, there's nothing you can't learn.{nl}{np} The lord is required by the law to pay for your upbringing, no matter how costly. Of course, if you're looking for more than basic education, you'll have to pay it all back to the lord once you become an adult.]{nl}{np} [So I get to live in the lord's castle?]{nl}[Not quite... Normally that is what happens, but your case is different. Someone else has volunteered to be your guardian.]{nl}[Who?]{nl}[I cannot tell you; not yet. But don't worry. Becoming an orphan's legal guardian is not only a matter of wealth or will, and we at the Kedora Alliance would never disregard the safety of a child.]{nl}{np} Kdit paused for a moment.{nl}[You don't have to call a neighbor, we will be taking you to your guardian ourselves.{nl}{np} Forgive me for this remark but, financially, what we're doing here is a loss for the Kedora Alliance.{nl}{np} This old house and everything in it is not enough to repay your father's loan. However, we will allow you to take anything you want with you.{nl}{np} That includes objects you may have hidden outside the house, of course, as long as you're able to carry them. Make sure to take anything you think is necessary or important.{nl}{np} We won't check even if you're hiding gold bars or other valuables, so I recommend you take as many as possible. Everything you leave behind will be appropriated and reutilized by the Alliance. We will you give you a few hours to prepare. When we return, I expect you to be ready to leave.]{nl}{np} Chridela acquiesced and Kdit gave her a short nod before exiting through the front door. The village elder quietly expressed his condolences to the girl before leaving the house.{nl}Kdit was still nearby when the elder came out.{nl}{np} They had promised Chridela time to prepare, so they began walking towards the village.{nl}A few steps on their way, the elder turned to Kdit.{nl}[I have to say, the Kedora Alliance is much more... generous than what I had imagined.]{nl}{np} Kdit smiled abashedly.{nl}[There's always something to be gained in everything the Alliance does. We give when we must give, and we take when we must take. It's only a question of maintaining balance. In a way, we can afford to be generous because of how effectively we make a profit.]{nl}{np} The village elder didn't quite agree with Kdit, but he chose not to contradict him.{nl}Instead, he said,{nl}{np} [I'm glad you found a guardian for Chridela. Our village doesn't have the means to look after the girl, and sending her to work for the lord would mean an entire life of menial jobs. She would probably end up in someone else's land, the poor girl...]{nl}{np} [That doesn't sound like a bad life at all.]{nl}[Considering she comes from a noble family, I would rather she followed another path, that's all.]{nl}Silently, Kdit nodded in agreement.{nl}{np} In his mind, however, the Kedora Alliance official had other thoughts.{nl}'If she fails to prove herself to her guardian, she might as well marry a farmer and live a quiet life in the countryside. She may not have a choice right now, but with her attitude, there's no telling what the future of this girl will be...'",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

The man's name was Frium.{nl}She had never been fond of him, so she did not try to start a conversation. It was Frium who broke their silence.{nl}{np} [Honestly, I've always admired you. I mean, out of the 29 boys and girls he sponsored, look at how many actually got to the level he expected. Almost none! But you... You exceeded all expectations.{nl}{np} At your age, the only person who can compare to you in combat is probably the Fencer Master, that Sorsha girl. And she's a Hutton; she was practically born with a sword in her hands. Considering how much you achieved in only five years, I'd say you're pretty remarkable.]{nl}{np} Chridela couldn't stand being quiet any longer.{nl}[Even the least talented of us was still above average. It was you who set the standards too high, for no good reason.]{nl}{np} [You think so? Our high standards weren't there to measure your achievements, you know. Dedication, loyalty... that's what we were looking for. Or at least a level of talent that could make up for the lack of those things.{nl}{np} To be honest, I don't really trust you. But I don't think you're a dishonest person, either. What I do know for sure is that you are a very talented woman. Frighteningly so.]{nl}{np} [Well, you're something special yourself. For someone who can't defend himself, you're pretty brave around people who don't exactly fancy you.]{nl}{np} [Eh, when you're running a battle arena you get used to being around fighters, murderers, all sorts of scary people. I'm just doing my job. You can't let something as irrational as fear get in the way of your dreams.]{nl}{np} [Oh, I know. In fact, I learned that from you, Frium. You certainly don't let anything as irrational as morals or basic humanity get in your way.]{nl}{np} [That's what I mean, you need to grow some claws. The sharper they get, the sooner you can get rid of us. Not that I expect much of you if you do.]{nl}{np} Frium's steps came to a halt as they reached a closed door.{nl}He knocked a couple of times and, promptly, the door opened to reveal a simple room containing nothing but a crude table and a few stools, with the Monk Master sitting on one of them.{nl}{np} Frium waited for Chridela to enter the room and bow to the Master before silently closing the door and leaving.{nl}[Sit.]{nl}Chridela merely glanced at a stool, hesitating on the Monk Master's order.{nl}{np} Olfas Grimm smiled wryly.{nl}[How are you ever going to kill me with all that indecision? If you're sure about it, then take action. It's not like you're lacking in talent...]{nl}{np} Chridela took out a stool and sat down without responding.{nl}[Are you not sure if you can kill me? Or are you still trying to hold on to your pride as an old member of the noble class? Hey?]{nl}{np} [Enough. Why did you call me here?]{nl}[Right. Well, I was looking everywhere for a nice spot for you, but the opportunity was never there. Class Master vacancies aren't exactly easy to come by, as you know.{nl}{np} At the same time, I couldn't just put you into some cleric order or have you learn magic, could I? But now, now I think you might have a real chance at something.]{nl}For the first time, Chridela Otero seemed interested in the Master's words.{nl}{np} [Is there a Class Master retiring?]{nl}[It's the Matador Master.]{nl}Chridela was confused.{nl}[But I was never trained in Matador combat. And to be honest, I have no interest in Masters connected to the arena.]{nl}{np} [Sure, if you're lucky there could be another empty spot, but if you let it go this could be the last vacancy you'll see in your life. You need to take the chance. Besides, someone of your caliber can learn the Matador style in no time; training won't be a problem.{nl}{np} Even judging by your combat skills alone, you're well within the level accepted for Masters of this field. I know you're interested in the position of Fencer Master, but Sorsha Hutton is still young, and very strong. Heck, not even a scandal could bring her down... That's why you need to take this chance.]{nl}{np} [What about the students of the current Matador Master? You don't expect them to just accept someone out of nowhere taking their place, do you?]{nl}[Frium and I took care of that. Also, you may not know this, but people close to the Matador Master are actually fond of you. It helps that you're a good-looking woman.{nl}{np} As long as you show them that you're good and that you're familiar enough with the Matador techniques, that shouldn't be a problem. Come next year you'll probably be better than all of them, anyway.]{nl}Chridela didn't reply, still pondering on her decision.{np} The Monk Master took one look at her and asked,{nl}[Something else on your mind? It's about me, isn't it?]{nl}[I was just thinking about the law that forbids Class Masters from carrying out personal disputes through violence.]{nl}{np} Grimm let out a short chuckle.{nl}[Hah. I know what you're thinking. But the Matador Master is a Master of the arena. The same arena I so often visit as the combat enthusiast that I am. You'll have plenty of opportunities, kid.{nl}{np} But if you really want to kill me, don't you need to pay me back first? I'm pretty sure you can't do anything to me until your debt is repaid. If I remember correctly, it was that strong determination of yours that made me keep you all this time.]{nl}{np} [Five years!]{nl}[What?]{nl}[Five years. You adopted me for five years, so that is how much I owe you. After that, you will have no right to demand anything from me.]{nl}{np} [I beg to differ. Aren't you forgetting something? We didn't just support you with food and shelter. We trained you in the finest martial arts and made you into a capable fighter. We settled not only your personal debt, but your family's as well. Not to mention...]{nl}{np} [Five years and three favors. That's as much as I'm willing to offer.]{nl}Chridela had raised her voice over the Monk Master's and was now looking directly at him.{nl}{np} Olfas Grimm was taken aback by her stare, but he quickly shrugged it off with a cackle.{nl}[Hahah. Alright. You work for us for five years. And you need to complete three missions for me. That's it, after that you're a free woman. I know you're a proud descendant of a noble family, so I trust you to keep your promise.]{nl}{np}[I will, but that doesn't mean I don't have my limits. For one, you can't force me to protect your life as my last mission.]{nl}[I'm not a fool. I'm only going to demand favors which I know you won't or can't refuse. Be it in the five years that you serve us, or in the three missions you agreed to complete.{nl}{np} Besides, I may avoid fighting strong people like you, but I'm no weakling myself. Do I look like a man who's afraid of death? The only reason I haven't died yet is because I have things to do. It's not because I want to live.]{nl}{np} [You know what they say about hopeless dreams...]{nl}[You can make fun of me all you want. But the fact is that you still need to prepare for the position of Matador Master. You can start by reading these.]{nl}{np} Grimm picked up a pile of books from behind him and dropped them on the table before leaving in silence. Chridela watched him for a moment, but soon turned her attention to the heap of books. She picked one up and turned on a reading lamp.{nl}{np} {nl}""The first combat arenas and gladiators date back to around 900 years ago, to the reign of King Melkhiel.{nl}In time, the arenas began to develop, with more and more specialized varieties of gladiator differentiating themselves from their peers.""{nl}{np} ""Then, around 300 ago during the reign of King Freenel, as the Kingdom opened itself up to the exterior, foreign customs and traditions began to permeate the arenas. This lead to the creation of even more new specializations, like the Matadors.""{nl}{np} ""Although battles with animals and demons were already common in arenas around the Kingdom, the Matadors introduced a new style of combat which infused elements of pure spectacle into fierce confrontations with evil beasts.""{nl}{np} ""Evil beasts can be distinguished from demons by their lack of intelligence. While both originate from a demonic realm, evil beasts are equivalent to the animals that exist in our world.{nl}Facing these beasts, especially within the arena, required specialized knowledge and experience in combat techniques that were largely unknown prior to the emergence of the Matadors.""{nl}{np} ""Knowledge of evil beasts first arrived in the Kingdom through an arena manager who collected information from foreign tribal societies. The manager adapted their skills and know-how to his own expertise to design a new style of combat.""{nl}{np} ""His research and practices eventually gave origin to an entirely new profession in the arena. Throughout his life, he continued to polish and add new elements to the technique, until he acquired the official position of Master of the Matador class.""{nl}{np} ""The methods developed by the first Matador were considered highly innovative at the time, due to how they incorporated artistic notions in a style of combat tailored specifically to arena battles performed in front of an audience.""{nl}{np} ""The first big change in the Matador tradition is often pointed out as the time when the original techniques used against evil beasts were expanded and adjusted to include one-on-one confrontations.""{nl}{np} ""Although Matadors were often assisted by other fighters in combat, the need to face demonic beasts solo made it so that, over the course of three centuries, the profession of Matador became more and more specialized in this kind of conflict.""{nl}{np} ""Thus, unlike their predecessors who mastered the art of performing with evil beasts, the Matadors of today are largely recognized by their outstanding command of one-on-one combat.""{nl}{np} Chridela put down the book and picked up another one. She slowly browsed through the books in the pile one by one before concluding,{nl}[Does he expect me to learn everything by theory? I think I should at least watch some Matador matches tomorrow...]{nl}{np} With that, she placed the books in a bag, turned off the light and left.{nl}If she was going to read all night, she may as well do it in the comfort of her own room, Chridela thought.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0

A person who was not closely related to the order.{nl}His name was Phrevy. A middle-aged man sent by the Inquisitor Master, Thomas Iquinostasys, to witness the proceedings as the Zealot Master's position was now vacant.{nl}{np} Not open to outsiders and with little connection to other clergy, if it was not a meeting requiring an official appearance, it was not necessary for those like the Inquisitors to attend.{nl}{np} Yet, during this assembly, if the next Zealot Master was selected, it would be Phrevy who would have to verify the process, report back to the Inquisitor Master and later relay the message to the proper department of the Kingdom.{nl} {np} For generations, the Zealot Order would elect their Master and this person would make an appearance before the Inquisitor and other orders of the goddesses for approval before alerting the king. If there was no reason for adjustment the process would be complete.{nl}{np} Since it was typical for the Order to elect a new Master before the previous one had either passed away or retired, even if the Inquisitor Phrevy formally knew little about the proceedings, there was really not much to observe. {np} But this time, the assembly had reached a standstill.{nl}Therefore, including the dispatched Phrevy, all who were in attendance were determined that a decision must be reached.{nl}{np} Moreover, Phrevy was selected to act as chair for the assembly, thus proving that the friction within the Order was more serious than previously thought.{nl}{np} Although the Zealot Order did not consist of many members, they were divided and the span of the Order's history was practically the same as the two sides' lasting conflict. {nl}{np} The Zealot Order was founded to recover the missing goddesses. However, the Order had separated into those who wished to seek out Goddess Laima first and those who wished to seek out Goddess Jurate. Both carrying their own opinions and reasoning for the matter.{nl}{np} There were those who believed Goddess Dahlia to be of the utmost importance, but compared to the other two groups whose numbers were 30 and 40, they carried no weight and dispersed themselves amongst the others.{nl}The end result being that their opinions on Goddess Dahlia were ignored.{nl}{np} Although this discord went on for some time, the Zealot Order was not divided.{nl}As a smaller order, they were aware of their precarious situation.{nl}And, even if the search for one goddess became paramount, they did not turn a blind eye on opportunities to find others.{nl}{np} This was because their mission was to find all the Goddesses, not to find a specific one.{nl}What was most important was their role to support the other existing Goddesses, their Orders, and the other Clerics.{nl}{np} Although the Zealots were not popular, because their goal was to find the missing goddesses, the other orders did not oppose them. Whether for honor's sake or out of empathy, they could do nothing but help the Zealot Order. {np} Because of this, the Zealots made their conflict known to the others in order to ensure that the matter did not make the already small order be forced to take on even more hardship.{nl}{np} At a previous assembly, David Tal, who was from the Laima followers, rose to a seat of power and was elected the Zealot Master.{nl}Those who served Jurate did not complain as, before this assembly, he had married Naomi, the daughter of an influential member of the Jurate followers.{nl}{np} For a short time it seemed as though the century old conflict would dissolve thanks to the marriage and David's successful ruling of the Order.{nl}He had gathered the Order's power and prepared them in the direction of finding Goddess Laima.{nl}{np} When a single lead appeared, he gathered a small group of Zealots and followed in pursuit.{nl}But the fact that the lead was fruitful is the sorrow of this story.{nl}It was here that David Tal faced his death, as he encountered another group who were in pursuit of Goddess Laima.{nl}{np} When David Tal passed away, the Order was stuck with heartache and further separation.{nl}After much backlash, Naomi succeeded her husband and became Zealot Master. However, a heavy atmosphere followed as there were those who followed Laima that believed it was because of Naomi that they lost David.{nl} {np} For many years Naomi ruled and, from pressure within the Order and due to her own personal interests to find her husband's killers, she continued their pursuit for Goddess Laima.{nl}These matters were one and the same and did not need to be pursued separately, yet the result led to her death as she too fell victim to those with connection to her husband's death.{nl}{np} (It would be revealed much later, but the one who played the main role behind their deaths was Evoniphon.{nl}Yet this truth would come much later to Aliza Tal, and by then Evoniphon would have had already left this world.){nl}{np} It was due to this second death that today's funeral and assembly had taken place.{nl}And the reason for the current emotional divide between those who purse Laima and those who pursue Jurate.{nl}{np} There were extremists on one side who believed that if it wasn't for the pressure from those of the Order, Naomi Tal would not have been so reckless, and those on the other side who thought that the very marriage of David and Naomi was the problem.{nl}{np} Of course, there were those whose opinions were not as extreme, but it was unclear in which direction the assembly would go as their feelings of grief and resentment had yet to pass.{nl}The Zealot, who requested from Inquisitor Phrevy to speak first, stepped forward.{nl}{np} [I believe that the Zealot who has served our order the longest and who carries with them years of experience should be our next Master.]{nl}The person who fit these conditions was a follower of Laima.{nl}Another Zealot requested permission to speak and offered another opinion.{nl}{np} [Someone with experience is fine, but a Zealot who is strong and well disciplined would be better. I say this as it would be improper to overlook one who has the skill needed to be the next Master.] {np} This person was from a follower of Jurate. Although it seemed as though neither side had a person they wanted to recommend to speak, a third person requested.{nl}{np} [In all our years, we have yet to face a situation where two of our leaders have died and we have not selected another to lead. In this unprecedented moment, I would like to recommend that we consider another approach, different from history, when selecting the next head of the Order.]{nl}{np} Here the question of what may that be was raised.{nl}Already prepared, the speaker calmly answered.{nl}[Our Order has set our sights on the task of finding the missing goddesses, but we have yet to succeed. I believe this to be because our Order is too independent and is, without proper reason, filled with pride.]{nl}{np} The assembly erupted with cries about other clerics being complacent with the current situation and lazy in comparison.{nl}But after Inquisitor Phrevy quieted them down, the speaker continued.{nl}{np} [What you are saying is not wrong. However, receiving even the smallest bit of help from them and the goddesses that they follow would not be bad.] With that said, the speaker continued with a counterargument.{nl}{np} [In truth, we have not received an answer from the other goddesses about the whereabouts of Goddess Laima. There are various reasons for this but one, in particular, is that we as humans do not know the whole story. However, we should still be proud of ourselves for the handwork it takes to ask such questions.{nl}{np} The other clerics have accepted the work of the goddesses, but it is all of us who feel hurt at their absence. This is why I think it would be acceptable for us to put our faith in the Oracle Master at this time. Is it not possible that in this time of crisis the goddess will show us the way?]{nl}{np} An other Zealot addressed the question.{nl}[The goddess knows what is best for us but She will not intervene with our choices. If this was not the case, the goddess would make it known to us who amongst the royals would be the best King.{nl}{np} Or better yet, we wouldn't even need a royal family. Finding who amongst us should be king would be a simple task. Just have the goddess provide us with the proper ruler. At this point, why not have the goddess simply sit on the throne Herself and rule?{nl}{np} Then we will not even have to worry about the monarch. You have studied our theology. Are you saying that you are unaware of the flaws in this thinking?]{nl}{np} [That is correct, however, 200 years ago King Enael was nominated through the Oracle. The king before, King Olukel was the first to step down from the throne due to intervention by the goddess. There are times when these means are necessary.{nl}{np} The goddesses from our faith and theology take deep consideration for human will, but this does not mean They will stop it. Let us ask. Let us seek out the Oracle. If we do not receive an answer, we will simply return here.{nl}{np} It will take time, but nothing else. If the divine goddess breaks from tradition and intervenes, I doubt that anyone here of the Zealot Order will object to Her decision.]{nl}{np} Inquisitor Phrevy, whose role was to judge the decisions of the assembly, examined those before him.{nl}It seemed no one disagreed. Either they all concurred or there were only a few who didn't.{nl}It was at this time that another person requested the floor.{nl}{np} It was a young woman who had just come of age.{nl}Aliza Tal, whose mother was the Zealot Master who passed away, and whose father was the Master who passed away the time before, spoke.{nl}{np} [I agree that we should speak with the Oracle. But I have one request. I would like us to ask the Oracle, not who should be the next master, but if I, Aliza Tal, would be fit for the role.{nl}{np} My brothers and sisters, you have suggested we select one who has years of experience and is well disciplined in our teachings. Although I do not have such qualifications I would like to know.{nl}{np} If it is I who is meant to continue my parent's, the previous Master's, dream of unity within the order and recovery of the goddesses.{nl}{np} If the prophecy is for me, I will be able to fulfill our goals as I have learned the teachings and thoughts of both sides and within me is the blood of our Order.{nl}{np} If my brothers and sisters agree with seeking the Oracle along with my request, and if I receive the goddess' blessing, I will follow the guidance of the prophecy.]{nl}{np} The members of the Order nosily spoke amongst themselves.{nl}After their talks had cooled, a few rose from their seats and whispered into the ear of the moderator, Inquisitor Phrevy.{nl}After listening to the opinions of these representatives of the Order, Inquisitor Phrevy began to speak.{nl}{np} [All are in agreement to speak with the Goddess through the Oracle Master. The question to be asked will be about the role of Aliza Tal. If there are any Zealots who oppose this decision, speak now.]{nl}He waited, but there was no one who objected.{nl}{np} [Good. Then the plan is in motion. If Aliza Tal rejects the prophecy, or the prophecy given does not pertain to her, the task of choosing the next nominee is once again the responsibility of the Zealot Order and we will return to this place again to discuss the matter.{nl}{np} We will now bring this assembly to a close and return after receiving the prophecy.] Three days later the Order, to the surprise of the other clerics, received their message through the Oracle Master. {np} The result revealed that Aliza Tal was to become the Zealot Master.{nl} The path ahead for this young Master could be one of honor or one of unbearable hardship.

Right-click to read. ,icon_item_collection_00basic,,,,,,#N/A,1," * The Shadow Master's Experiment Journal Part 1{nl}{np} Ubik took a deep breath and turned around.{nl}She saw, in the seats provided, the various mage Masters sitting side by side.{nl}Some were apathetic, while others looked on with anticipation.{nl}But regardless of how there Masters felt, Ubik did not want to fail before any of them.{nl}{np} With great composure, Ubik signaled towards her students and a monster began to take shape from the shadows.{nl}{np}  Remembering its name would be a task for another day.{nl}Ubik, knowing it would be a failure to lose focus now, carefully, but with quick precision, completed her casting.{nl}{np} The monster's pursuing shadow shot out into four arrows - arrows so sharp they hung like needles.{nl}{np} These arrows embedded themselves, one by one, into each of the monster's four feet.{nl}The monster let out a shriek as it found itself pinned to the ground.{nl}{np} The shadow crawled from the monster's feet up to its legs threading and separating into separated arrows above and below, crisscrossing around and swiftly piercing the monster's body with sixteen strikes.{nl}{np} The shadow then rose above the monster and formed into a gigantic lance and whatever breath was left was taken away with one swift strike that pierced the monster's head.{nl}{np} The demonstration complete, Shadowmancer Master Ubik turned to face the various Masters that sat on the platform behind her.{nl}The first to comment was the Sorcerer Master, Dame Circe.{nl}{np} [That shadow control is something that can only be seen at the Master's level, no? I think it would be hard for other Shadowmancers to follow. You have gathered too many Masters here to perform a feat that only one of Master level can perform.]{nl}{np} Before Ubik could respond with [That little...], Wican Celestic stepped in.{nl}{np} [Circe is correct. If it is a skill of this level that other Shadowmancer cannot follow then it is indeed nothing but magically valuable.{nl}{np} Also, seeing as how the Sorcerer Master also has a similar skill to reflect a demon's shadow, you may not be able to invoke the amount that she can summon.]{nl}{np} While Ubik thought that Wican always agrees with Circe, Winona Ende spoke up.{nl}[But Ubik is not fighting Circe, and not all sorcerer can control demons like Sorcerer Master. It is not completely useless.]{nl}{np} This time Ili Teird spoke.{nl}[You are all correct. However, let us move on to the next demonstration. If we continue to discuss after each display, one day will not be enough.]{nl}With that, Ubik turned back around and motioned again to her students, who released a second monster.{nl}{np} This time without appearing to move, Ubik pinned the monster to the ground.{nl}And this time Thaumaturge Master Larisa was first to gave her opinion.{nl}{np} [Isn't this the normal skill of a Shadowmancer? To pin down an opponent's shadow so that is unable to move? It's a skill that they all know.]{nl}[Correct,] Ubik answered and signaled.{nl}{np} Her students began to turn on and off the magic flames that were prepared on all sides. Even during the day the flames were strong and more shadows of the monster appeared. But that was not all.{nl}{np} The monster began to be yanked around by the shadows that had just newly formed.{nl}And as it was restrained to its shadow, if the shadow suddenly appeared in another location or drastically changed shape or direction, the body too was forcefully moved to follow suit.{nl}{np} Each time the monster hit the ground it received physical damage.{nl}The monster was then dragged into the air and slammed into the hard ground multiple times until the monster was no more.{nl}Ubik turned around again to face the other Master's criticisms.{np} This time again Sorcerer Master Circe was the first to speak.{nl}[To fight like this, isn't it a problem to have to prepare lighting every time?]{nl}{np} Linker Master Winona Ende Spoke afterward.{nl}[I can use linking technology well, and I can do it without preliminaries if I instantly place a glowing object like a fireball or something of magic every side.{nl}{np} This is a technical application for a joint battle with other mages. This might be the original intention.]{nl}Ubik liked that Winona mentioned linkage attacks.{nl}But that did not last long as Psychokino Ili Terid soon said:{nl}{np} [But if you're going to give the enemy a physical shock like that, why don't you just do this?]{nl}After saying so, Ili Terid grabbed, with his telekinesis power, the body of the monster that was already dead and he waved it back and forth.{nl}Wican Celestic intervened without hesitation.{nl}{np} [Of course if there are times where I cannot get the help of Telekinesis or Psychokino, that would be the situation when I would need this. But it doesn't seem very efficient.]{nl}Sorcerer Master Circe rose from her sit and spoke,{nl}{np} [I understand that the Shadowmancer Master has taken Shadowmancer magic to a higher level. But I don't feel as though the other mage Masters necessarily needed to see it. I would like to see more, but sadly I'm too busy. This is all I will watch for today.]{nl}{np} With that, Dame Circe along with Wican Celestic said their goodbyes.{nl}The other mage Masters, some of which were interested in the demonstration and wanted to stay, were divided on what to do next.{nl}{np} At the time, the quiet Chronomancer Master Lucid Winterspoon rose from her chair.{nl}As she was their elder, the other Masters as well stood up and began to say their goodbyes to Ubik.{nl}{np} Although the first to stand, Lucid Winterspoon was the last to approach.{nl}[It seems that my action has caused a  reaction through the others, but that was not my true intention.]{nl}Ubik heard this and spoke,{nl}{np} [Was that not what you had intended when you rose from your seat?]{nl}[Yes, there was that. But that was not all. I wanted to speak with you alone.]{nl}Ubik was both excited and worried about what this living legend of magic has to say.{nl}{np} Lucid Winterspoon said,{nl}[As a result, of magic you just demonstrated, you were able to send the body of the tied down shadow to another place. If you develop this further you would be able to apply this to teleportation. Have you thought of that?]{nl}{np} [But to do that, I will have to solve the problem of physical shock upon arrival. The further the distance the stronger the shock. So of course, you could send the monster a shorter distance and they will not be damaged. But it depends.]{nl}{np} Lucid Winterspoon grinned at hearing those words and said,{nl}[If that was the only problem, then in comparison it would be easily solvable.]{nl}Ubik thought for a moment and replied,{nl}{np} [Plus, another problem is, if you want to send the shadow further, one will need stronger lighting as well. And lights need to be installed the further the location. Plus if the body isn't there, there is no way to send the shadow of that body first.]{nl}{np} [Then what if you do not use your own shadow. What if you used the shadow of something else?]{nl}{np} [I've never considered that so I'm not sure if it is possible. I would have to come to that conclusion through research, no? To send my shadow or to send the shadow of someone else, the problem is still the same as the one before.{nl}{np} Without a way to call on stronger lights and the shadow first, the body will still need to go to the place to reach the shadows.]{nl}Lucid Winterspoon grinned again and said,{nl}{np} [And if that shadow was the moon's?]{nl}At those words, Ubik's expression changed.{nl}[That's genius! If you can utilize the shadow of the solar or lunar eclipse then one can call upon it from anywhere. I hadn't thought of that.]{np} Lucid Winterspoon spoke again.{nl}[Well, try. Teleportation has been considered inefficient but until trying, you won't know. How would you feel about researching this type of magic? I will be able to help you from time to time.]{nl}{np} [Yes, why not? I will start from today. Thank you so much. This is an amazing idea, Master Lucid.]{nl}And from that day forward, the Shadowmancer Master was known as Eclipse Ubik.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0
690100,BULLET_MARKER_MASTER_BOOK01,Story of Bullet Marker Flint Winterwood. Right-click to read. ,icon_item_collection_00basic,,,,,,#N/A,1," * Winter Flint{nl}{np} A mansion, dating back centuries, had been overtaken by a melancholy mood that matched its aging years. {nl}Yet, it was not always like that.{nl}Just a few weeks ago, the mansion glowed with the prestige it had gathered over the years and the atmosphere not so heavy.{nl}{np} But, the actions of a certain someone led to a family meeting being held in a mood so somber that it affected not only the disposition of the mansion but the extended family as well.{nl}Walking down a corridor of this mansion, in the direction of the meeting, were two men and one woman.{nl}{np} Of these three people, the one to the far right, Vaidotas Winterspoon, addressed the man walking to his left.{nl}[I did wrong. I will not do so again in the future. That is what you will say. Understood? Don't speak of anything else.]{nl}{np} The woman interjected. [But, why must our Flint apologize? And you, Vaidotas, are being quite annoying.]{nl}[You are the annoying one, Lucienne. Do you then think it's alright for Flint to be punished?]{nl}[What did he do that this is the case?{nl}{np} [I also think he did nothing wrong. But if it's all so simple, why have the elders gone so far as to hold a family meeting?]{nl}[For the elders to feel the need to do so, shows how old fashioned they are. If Flint inherits the head of the household our family will have to change as well.]{nl}{np} [It's important that he first endures today's meeting before considering his inheritance.]{nl}Although Flint was carefully listening to the words of his cousins, he did not speak.{nl} It was not that he refused to answer, but rather he had yet to decide what it was that he would do.{nl}{np} Whether they were aware of this or not, Vaidotas and Lucienne continued their debate until the three of them arrived at the doors of the meeting.{nl}Just before opening the door, Vaidotas stressed his previous thoughts onto Flint one final time.{nl}{np} The door, now opened, revealed dozens of men and women sitting inside the hall.{nl} A look around and one would note a single, remote chair that was prepared as though its future occupant was to face trial or interrogation. To the front and at an angle on either side of this chair, the men and women waited.{nl}{np} Vaidotas and Lucienne took their seats in their respective places.{nl}And, without a word, Flint Winterspoon, the man who had followed them both, took his place at the center in the lone chair.{nl}{np} However you viewed it, this event was for him. Although his seat seemed that of a criminal on trial, he was today's main protagonist.{nl}In other words, today these people would judge if he would be a hero or a villain. {nl}From that perspective, you could say he was less like a criminal waiting trial and more like an actor awaiting the reviews of the audience.{nl}{np} Now there was but one place of honor that remained empty.{nl}If this place was also filled then the hall would seat 33.{nl}However, if one excludes the man sitting in the place of the defendant, there were only 31 people sitting around him, staring him down.{nl}{np} An elderly man, sitting to the right of the empty place of honor, opened his mouth to speak. {nl}[With this, the current members of the Winterspoon family who have completed the rite of passage, for the exception of one, have all gathered here today. In place of our vacant Patriarch, I will take the role of eldest and announce the start of the 817th Family Meeting.]{nl}{np} He paused slightly before continuing.{nl}[Kohath Winterspoon you have requested the right to speak and thus, you may go first.]{nl}To his right, a man sitting in the center of the group rose, bowed his head towards the rest of the family in greeting, and spoke.{nl}{np} [This meeting was originally intended to be a joyful one to fill the vacancy of the Patriarch in the family. However, it is unfortunate that one of our members, who was a strong candidate for such a position, has been suspected of violating the family law and the rules of the alchemists. This meeting now serves as an investigation.{nl}{np} Our family has been regarded for centuries as the most prestigious in the kingdom and the very founders of alchemy.]{nl}{np} Kohath took a breath, then spoke on. {nl}One. An Alchemist's research and results will not interfere with the divine providence of the Goddesses.{nl}Two. An Alchemist's research and results will not bring harm to the Goddesses.{nl}{np} Three. An Alchemist will never use the Goddesses or humans as raw material.{nl}All Alchemist will seek to follow the aforementioned provisions and will work to ensure others do as well. {nl}As you know, as a member of this family, these are the first sentences you learn and last that you keep until the day you die.{nl}{np} Yet, it seems that Flint Winterspoon has allowed these rules to slip his mind. He hopes to use alchemy to craft more powerful weapons. If we begin to use the skills and capability of our family to create such things, what sort of issues will arise?{nl}{np} What sort of horrible place will our world become if these weapons exist? I judge that we stop this type of research and experimentation. There is not one person in the history of the Winterspoon family who has directly used alchemy to develop weapons.{nl}{np} No, even more, no one has spared the thought. And to come here and hear that the person who will be inheriting the family hopes to use alchemy as a foundation to create weapons cannot be ignored.]{nl}When he was done, a young man raised his hand and asked for permission to address the family.{nl}The elderly man gave such permission with his eyes, and the younger one began.{nl}{np} It was Vaidotas Winterspoon. {nl}[What was just said does not match the truth. Cheminis Sword, Vine Equipment, Riena Equipment and more were all created by our family or were provided for by our skill. With these weapons we have made great contributions to the kingdom by saving many lives.{nl}{np} If we consider this example, and continue to think that making weapons with alchemy is a problem then this would lead to the absurd thinking that all blacksmiths and weapon makers in our world are killers who do not know the sanctity of life.]{nl}{np} Although a select few nodded at Vaidotas words, Kohath did not stand down.{nl}[Do you think I don't know that? My nephew knows of only one thing and speaks unknowingly of the second. Do you know how long ago gun powder was invented?{nl}{np} During the time of Sosel the 2nd, our family created gun power, yet as time passed, as powerful as it may be, gun power based weapons did not become the norm. Even the majority of the Kingdom's soldiers use spears and swords. Have you considered why?{nl}{np} But before Vaidotas could retort, another person raised their hand.{nl}This time it was Lucienne Winterspoon. {nl}With permission, she began to speak.{nl}{np} [Nonetheless, the Royal Army does use Sappers and Cannons. The reason why the Kingdom tends not to use gun power is because they are already using weapons founded in magic and divine energy that are just as good as gun powder.{nl}{np} But this doesn't mean that gun power is weak. Guns and swords are all just weapons. Our family applied alchemy to swords and spears, so there is no reason for us not to do the same with gun powder based weapons.{nl}{np} It is our family that has developed gun power and we should consider it time to develop it further, Father.]{nl}And with grace Lucienne Winterspoon ended her appeal.{nl}{np} But Kohath words were harsh.{nl}[I have failed as my daughter’s teacher. From the time of Sosel the 2nd for thousands of years, you think that various patriarchs have not thought of applying such research because of a lack of curiosity or ability? It was through wisdom and discretion that they began to realize the dangers.]{nl}{np} Before either Lucienne or Vaidotas could recover permission to speak, the doors flew open and a single person walked in. Although not a usual attendant of such meeting, it was for this person that the highest chair of honor was left vacant.{nl}{np} And though not many were used to seeing her, all members of the family knew her face.{nl}It was not a face easy to forget even if seen only once over several decades. {nl}Time had passed and yet her features had not changed at all, making her all the more recognizable.{nl}{np} When she entered the room, the other members of the family rose from their seats and bowed their heads in reverence of the eldest member.{nl}And as she walked, she began to speak.{nl}{np} [Although I have attended great meetings, it has been awhile since I've attended one where the moment it opens a debate has already started.]{nl}The elderly man who was acting representative addressed her.{nl}[It has been awhile, Great Aunt.]{nl}The woman, Lucid Winterspoon casually nodded her head and disappeared.{nl}{np} Reappearing in the vacant chair high above.{nl}[As time went by I grew tired of being called Grandmother, Great Grandmother, Great-Great-Grandmother and asked to go by Great Aunt, but Kenaz, we are both old and to hear you call me that has put me off.]{nl}{np} Lucid Winterspoon took her seat and the rest if the family followed suit.{nl}As Kenaz Winterspoon considered what to say, Lucid stopped him.{nl}[In the time it took to approach this chair I saw all that had occurred here. You do not need to explain it to me.]{nl}{np} With that said, Lucid turned her attention to the man sitting in the defendant's chair, Flint Winterspoon.{nl}[It is not clear if pausing a heated discussion is the best idea,{nl} {np} but if the opinions differ so much as to start a fight and where opposing opinions could lead to further misunderstandings, the discussion must be put to rest. And I think that time has come.]{nl}{np} After speaking, Lucid took a moment to examine the other members one by one. She saw in them the descendants of her brothers and sisters who had long passed away centuries ago. Then spoke again.{nl}{np} [Although, I would like us to share our thoughts and wisdom to work towards an appropriate conclusion, I know that the truth is that we do not have the time.]{nl}{np} The elder man, Kenaz Winterspoon, who was acting speaker, spoke.{nl}[Great Aunt, as observer of time and eldest of us all, if you say as such then it is fine. However, we are aware that you often separate yourself from the events of the family and even that of the outside world, but{nl} {np} sometimes there are times where you do interfere and only afterwards do we understand why. If there is a patriarch that you wish to chose, then we will trust your wisdom and gather together to prepare for such a person.{nl} {np} No matter who is selected by you, we will not refuse them.]{nl}[My answer does not bear with it wisdom of such expectation. And more importantly, it is not the wisdom of the decision that is important, but the effort set to reach the intended result.{nl}{np} Regrettably, time is short. Which is why I have given you the task of presiding over these assemblies.]{nl}[Speak.]{nl}Kenaz replied, but Lucid Winterspoon directed her next question towards Flint.{nl}{np} [This whole time, we still have not asked you of your opinion. Hearing the opinion of the others is important, but first we must hear from you. What are your thoughts? Do you wish to use alchemy to develop these powerful bullets and sell them?]{nl}{np} Flint Winterspoon, shocked by the appearance of a famous family member he had only heard stories about, was at a loss for words.{nl}As such, Lucid Winterspoon waited quietly for the answer and this was the result.{nl}{np} The time to personally meet Lucid Winterspoon and greet her or ask her questions had already passed, and as such his reply was short.{nl}[I would prefer if it was not summarized in that way, but your summary is not wrong. Great Aunt.]{nl}{np} Lucid Winterspoon turned back to the whole assembly{nl}[For the exception of a few, the majority of the family members here oppose this thought. I, for one, think that working on something again with alchemy that I have left untouched for the last 100 years would bring exciting developments...]{nl}{np} Kohath Winterspoon's mouth fell open and a weak indignant voice escaped his lips.{nl}[Great Aunt!]{nl}{np} But Lucid Winterspoon silenced him with a wave of her finger.{nl}[This is not the time to get excited, my boy. I simply mean that I do not wish to deal with the family's work here and there. And I am past the age of being able to do such exciting experiments...{nl}{np} She stopped and after a long paused continued again.{nl}[I understand that this is not the opinion you would like to hear. But if anyone shares a different one then feel free to speak. But right now, I will ask Flint. The work you would like to do, can you complete it with the help of our family?]{nl}{np} Flint's expression changed.{nl}It was because he had never let the thought cross his mind.{nl}Lucienne and Vaidotas, who were sitting amongst the family, shared a look over this exciting prospect and waited for Flint's response with anticipation.{nl}{np} The other family members as well shared a similar anticipation as they stared at Flint.{nl} His concerns were many, but time was short and the answer he had for himself was ever more so.{nl}Thus his answer came easy.{nl}{np} [Of course not. I would not need to focus on the Winterspoon's family power or influence. But, the problem remains that I will not be using my skills for the family.]{nl}{np} [If that is the case, why do you feel the need to convince them? If you have no interest in the patriarch seat, can't you simply go and do the work you wish? If you feel frustrated and unable to use your talents within the family, then leave. The family will not collapse without you.{nl}{np} I know this because I, too, have done nothing to contribute to the family for centuries.]{nl}Kohath and a few others wished to protest but,{nl} {np} the family, for centuries, faced no problems with the absence of Lucid's alchemy and there was no evidence to support the opinion that removing Flint would suddenly cause problems.{nl}{np} But Flint was still shocked by the idea of leaving the family, a thought that had never occurred to him. But as he thought about it the more the idea was to his liking.{nl}When Lucid Winterspoon saw this change she was prompted to speak.{nl}{np} [If Flint leaves the family, then whatever work he does we have no reason to interfere. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the foundation of Flint's work is our own teachings.{nl}{np} So, if you carry the Winterspoon name you cannot complete the work you would like to do. Whatever comes next will be difficult, and ending your connection with the family will also bring challenges, so in the future go by the name, Winterwood.{nl}{np} I ask that you use this name as a guide to remember to walk the path between what you have learned from the family and what you hope to do in your own work.]{nl}{np} Kohath spoke.{nl}[Saying he will leave the family does not excuse him from the rules of alchemy. It is not just our family but all Alchemists in the Kingdom -- no the world who must adhere to these immutable principles.]{nl}{np} Lucid Winterspoon replied.{nl}[I know your worries. But Flint is not the type of person to use what he has learned with reckless abandonment. You too already know this, no? And I also believe that in the long-term this work will be good for the family and for the advancement of our world.{nl}{np} Have you forgotten that I am a Chronomancer? And if you would like to discuss the rules of alchemy, it was I who was at the center of its creation. Forget the thought that you can tie me down using the fear of these principles.]{nl}{np} Kenaz, not waiting to miss the opportunity to keep the rarely seen Lucid Winterspoon involved with the family, spoke.{nl}[If it pleases you, how about also recommending the next head of the family? Just mention a promising person to be patriarch and you can go your way.]{nl}{np} If the person Lucid picks does become the next patriarch, and Lucid is there to help them the success of the family would be even greater.{nl}If one considers the generations of patriarchs who had begged Lucid earnestly for a single shred of advice, this was an opportunity the family could not let slip by.{nl}{np} [You should pick a person from the next generation. Vaidotas would do well. The family elders will help to guide the younger Patriarch...]{nl}Kohath who was ignoring Kenaz's gaze had a need to object this time too.{nl}{np} [Vaidotas' alchemist abilities are fine. But he does not share the same strength as Flint. He is but a scholar. And, as you know, to be the patriarch you need to have a certain level of fighting skill as well.]{nl}{np} On hearing this, Kenaz realized that Kohath was not opposed to Vaidotas as leader but rather wanted to restrain Lucid to the role of looking after a weaker patriarch.{nl}To ensure what this is what was said, Lucid Winterspoon spoke first.{nl}{np} [Since he is still young we can prepare him for the title and develop areas where is he lacking. If you feel anxious, we can send him to train. In fact, let us do this.{nl}{np} Recently, the Swordsman Master gave up his public office and retired to Klaipeda. Let us send Vaidotas to Klaipeda to receive his guidance.]{nl}The elder, Kenaz, spoke.{nl} {np} [Learning how to fight like a warrior isn't bad, but don't you think, if it is possible, learning how to fight as a Wizard from you, Great Aunt, would be simpler?]{nl}{np} [The Wizard Society would be in an uproar if I trained him. It would be seen as favoritism and I will still need to be responsible for the work I am supposed to do. Send him south.{nl} {np} Let him experience the Great Woodlands and other areas, and along the way I will teach him about the climate of each region and their special materials. It has been hundreds of years since I've trained someone in alchemy. But I will yield this amount. In this case you will arrive to Klaipeda a bit late, but warrior training needs not to be rushed.]{nl}{np} At this, Lucid stopped and closed her eyes for a moment.{nl}‘No…if our family’s members try to save this world, even just a small step it will prove difficult. We will have to match the time…{nl}{np} We cannot be too strong, nor weak, we must match the moment perfectly… It doesn’t need to be Vaidotas, but there is also no reason not to. As long as it does not interfere with the providence and expectations of the Goddesses, it will be okay…’{nl}And like that the thought disappeared.{nl}{np} Of course, she could not share her thinking with the others.{nl}Instead, she turned to Flint and spoke.{nl}[You have given up the burden of Patriarch, but there is other work you must bear.{nl}{np} I will pray that the honor of the goddesses be revealed through you. You still retain half of the family name and for that you must carry our reputation with you.]{nl}{np} This frustrated Flint.{nl}[If someone else has said that I would not have found it so strange, but from you Great Aunt, I do not know.]{nl}At that accusation, Lucid replied.{nl}[Oh? But it is like that, no? Even if we go our separate ways, no matter how far we go, we cannot be fully apart.]{nl}{np} When those words were spoken, Lucid Winterspoon, without a single goodbye began to disappear.{nl}The remaining family members, who were used to this behavior, sent her off by bowing their heads.{nl}{np} Although they did not have the ability to see as far into the future as Lucid, they could feel that this was the start of a new era.{nl}However, not one of them remaining there knew how difficult this new era would be.",0.0,0.0,0000,2,1.0
